Background and Achievements 
Overview 
Kenya is host to 114,432 South Sudanese refugees as of end of October 2018. It continues to provide asylum and 
protection to those and other refugee populations mainly from the Horn and Great Lakes region of Africa. There has 
been a steady influx of South Sudanese refugees into Kenya since the resumption of hostilities in South Sudan in 
December 2013, however, it is expected that the numbers will decrease in 2019 and 2020 as a result of the 
implementation of the Peace Agreement signed in August 2018. 
In partnership with the Government of Kenya, RRP partners will work on a comprehensive protection and integrated 
development approach that focuses on: providing refugees with protection and assistance; promoting refugee and 
host community access to sustainable quality basic services (health, education, and water) and promoting economic 
inclusion and business opportunities. This will enhance peaceful coexistence between refugees and the host 
community. Gradually, the RRP partners will reposition themselves as a catalyst for change and provide technical 
assistance rather than direct protection and assistance to persons of concern (PoCs). 
The Government of Kenya maintains an open door asylum policy for new arrivals including from non-neighbouring 
countries such as Eritrea, Burundi, the Central African Republic and others. The process of integrating the refugee 
and host community socially and economically is being implemented in the Kalobeyei settlement. However, the 
long-term success of this approach requires significant investment in existing national services as well as in 
development projects and infrastructure in the refugee-hosting counties. An example of how this integration is taking 
place in the education sector is the use of the Kenyan curriculum for refugee learning and this enables refugees to 
sit for the Kenyan National examinations. RRP partners continue to support the education of refugees, with significant 
enrolment of children from pre-primary to post-primary education. The Government has registered Kakuma schools

as public entities but the schools do not benefit from government support as of yet. High level discussions and 
negotiations between RRP partners, the Government and the Ministry of Education (MoE) are ongoing regarding the 
integration of refugee education services into national structures and the development of a policy framework on 
inclusion of refugees. Furthermore, to enhance integration RRP partners are collaborating with development and 
financial institutions to help Kenya access the World Bank Development Response to Displacement Impacts Project 
in the Horn of Africa (DRDIP), as well as the IDA18 refugee sub-window which will finance development projects for 
the host communities. In spite of these positive development and even though in February 2017, the Court of Appeal 
ruled that the encampment policy was unconstitutional, the government’s encampment policy remains in effect and 
all PoCs are required to live in the camps (or the Kalobeyei Settlement). They must obtain authorisation to leave the 
camps and failure to do so exposes them to legal actions. 
The Government is taking on an increased role in the delivery of protection services and significant achievements 
have been made in handing over critical processes such as running the reception facilities and conducting 
registration and refugee status determination (RSD), with the aim of strengthening the national refugee management 
system. All South Sudanese PoCs are currently recognised on a prima facie basis as refugees. A challenge faced is 
the considerable delays and obstacles for refugees in accessing documentation such as refugee ID cards and 
dissemination of birth and death certificates. 
Kenya formally launched their application of the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF) in October 
2017. In advance of this, at the Leaders’ Summit on Refugees the Government of Kenya committed to enhancing 
refugees self-reliance and inclusion in Kenya specific ally be pledging to support the Kalobeyei Integrated 
Settlement, to facilitate the legal status of refugees with legitimate claims to Kenyan residence or citizenship and to 
implement the “Guidelines on Admission of Non-Citizen to Institutions of Basic Education and Training in Kenya 
which will facilitate school enrolment of refugees and other non- citizens in Kenya school. Among the progressive 
steps that followed the formal announcement of Kenya as a CRRF country is the inclusion of refugees in the draft 
County Integrated Development Plans (CIPD) of Turkana and Garissa and the inclusion of refugees in Kenya’s UN 
Development Assistance Framework 2018-2022. 
Needs Analysis 
In line with the CRRF approach, RRP partners and the 
Government will focus on expanding protection for 
refugees and promoting solutions including socioeconomic 
inclusion of both refugees and the host 
community and peaceful coexistence. The key needs 
highlighted in all participatory consultations include: 
provision of efficient and effective emergency life-saving 
activities, expanding risk management activities and 
ensuring accountability in the response, enhancing 
protection response, adopting an area-based 
development approach for refugees and host 
communities, strengthening capacity of national service 
providers, promoting access to livelihoods and 
education programmes, implementing efficient

K E N YA R R P F O R S O U T H S U DA N E S E > JA N UA R Y 2 0 1 9 - D E C EMB E R 2 0 2 0 7 
mechanisms for shifting from blanket to targeted 
assistance, and expanding the community-based 
engagement strategy in Kalobeyei. RRP partners will 
continue to focus on the provision of transitional shelters 
and non-food items (NFIs), stabilisation of malnourished 
or critically-ill refugees and the provision of accelerated 
learning programmes. There is also a need for 
conducting border monitoring, registration and provision 
of documentation for refugees and asylum-seekers as 
well as ensuring timely identification of and response to 
refugees with protection risks. The ongoing complexity 
of protection concerns like early marriage and the risk of 
abduction of girls for the purpose of forced marriage is 
increasing. 
Investment in risk management and ensuring 
accountability of the response is another key area. This 
can be achieved through expanding the use of 
innovative tools that allow refugees to monitor services 
delivery, increasing awareness of fraud and sexual 
exploitation and abuse among refugees, allow refugees 
to access their personal data and seek services from 
RRP partners through for example, the Kiosk for Access 
Service and Information( KASI) system and expand the 
use of the Application for Integration Management (AIM) 
for Protection and Solutions system to facilitate the 
resettlement processes, and the use of the WhatsApp 
communication tree. In addition to using innovative tools 
there is a need to increase RRP partners presence in the 
field, train staff in protection against sexual exploitation 
and abuse, improve effective reporting mechanisms, and 
enhance inter-agency coordination. 
There is a need to continue with the strategy among 
RRP partners to adopt an area-based development 
approach, benefiting both refugees and host community, 
in line with the Kalobeyei Integrated Socio-economic 
Development Programme (KISEDP) and the Turkana 
County Integrated Development Plan (CIDP) and expand 
the engagement of development actors and the private 
sector.RRP partners will have to continue to support the 
capacity building of national service providers. This will 
strengthen the integrity of work processes and expand 
the use of innovative solutions, improve inter-agency 
coordination mechanisms, reinforce government 
relations, and generate a stronger platform for 
implementing the KISEDP. Analysis shows that there is a 
need for RRP partners to double their efforts to ensure 
the availability of key services such as health, education 
and water for both refugees and host communities, 
advocate for development of large-scale renewable 
energy solutions and solar farms, construct water dams 
and pans to increase the water availability, and advocate 
for legal framework to allow for increased mobility and 
access to work for refugees. 
Another area requiring intervention is in terms of the 
need to further build the human and financial capital of 
the refugees and host community. This will require RRP 
partners to continue to advocate for refugees to be seen 
as economic agents, further expand livelihoods 
programmes through improving data-driven 
programming, promote business development and 
vocational training, entrepreneurship training, and job 
creation. Tertiary education opportunities must be 
expanded through the establishment of the university 
hub involving more than ten universities from different 
countries offering bachelor degrees and diplomas using 
often blended learning methodologies. There is a need 
for socio-economic surveys to inform welfare prediction 
models. Refugees with increased expenditure levels 
need to be identified and efforts must be made to 
graduate them from reliance on humanitarian assistance. 
A new community engagement strategy needs to be 
implemented through the increased use of community 
based organisations (CBOs) for the delivery of certain 
services, further expanding the use of cash-based 
interventions (CBI) for shelter, NFI and WASH sectors. 
SGBV protection responses to survivors needs to be 
scaled up as well as the implementation of safe schools 
projects. The response must focus on reducing its 
footprint in areas where refugees are willing to engage. 
There must be increased focus on promoting

engagement with diaspora, further promoting 
resettlement and complementary pathways focusing on 
labour mobility and family reunification. 
Response Strategy & Priorities 
Throughout 2019-2020, RRP partners will provide protection and solutions-oriented interventions to all South 
Sudanese refugees as well as interventions aimed at promoting peaceful coexistence. Central to this is the 
strengthening of the national asylum management system and further support for the creation of a conducive 
environment that promotes long-term sustainable solutions. 
RRP partners will continue advocating to maintain the asylum space in its humanitarian and civilian character. Regular 
border and detention monitoring will continue to ensure that unhindered access to the territory remains and that no 
refoulement takes place. Cooperation with the immigration authorities will be increased. The Security Partnership 
Project will be extended and police officers further trained to discharge their roles. The influx of South Sudanese and

K E N YA R R P F O R S O U T H S U DA N E S E > JA N UA R Y 2 0 1 9 - D E C EMB E R 2 0 2 0 9 
others will continue to be managed through the existing reception facilities. RRP partners will improve the referral 
and management of individual cases through innovative tools like KASI and AIM, and efficient use of the existing 
data and information systems and scale up response to early identification of child protection cases, SGBV survivors, 
and safe schools projects. 
RRP partners will assist to further develop the Refugee Affairs Secretariat (RAS) and the Turkana County Government 
as strong entities moving forward the national CRRF agenda of the government. As with registration, the role of RRP 
partners will be limited to quality control and further training of the RAS on audit tools and integrity measures after 
the full handover of registration activities. RRP partners will focus on further promoting resettlement and 
complementary pathways focusing on labour mobility and family reunification. RRP partners will also support an 
increased number of applications for Kenyan citizenship submitted by refugees married to Kenyan nationals, as well 
as the dissemination of birth and death certificates issued by the Government of Kenya. 
Education is an important component of the CRRF approach which places emphasis on inclusion of asylum-seekers 
and refugees in national systems and multi-stakeholder partnerships in support of host governments, in line with the 
Djibouti Declaration signed by Kenya in December 2017. Kenya’s legal instruments provide a solid foundation for the 
inclusion of refugee learners in the national education system. The Kenyan Constitution (2010) and the Basic 
Education Act (2013) provide access to education as the right of every child in Kenya, including non-citizens. 
Using these national commitments as a basis, along with protection and education strategies, RRP partners will 
progressively seek to advance the integration of refugees in the national education system and provide financing to 
strengthen national systems with a focus on the delivery of quality education and learning outcomes for refugees 
and host community children. 
This includes addressing education supply and demand barriers through the expansion and improvement of existing 
school spaces to reduce overcrowding and facilitate further enrolment for out of school children. The provision of 
learning materials to enhance the quality of teaching and learning in school and support for extra-curricular activities, 
improvement of the quality of education data and information and targeted interventions to improve participation of 
girls, over-age children and those with disabilities will remain a key focus. 
The gradual implementation of the CRRF approach will translate into increased socio-economic inclusion of South 
Sudanese refugees and a reduction of their dependency on assistance. RRP partners will continue working with the 
Government to ensure the successful implementation of the Kalobeyei initiative. The development projects funded 
by the World Bank will have started to deliver benefits for the host communities and complement RRP partners 
programming. The RRP partners will continue to support the capacity development of national service providers to 
support their presence in the refugee-hosting areas and will expand the use of innovative solutions in service 
delivery. RRP partners will continue to support increased use of refugee community based organisations for delivery 
of certain services, while expanding the use of CBIs for shelter, NFI and WASH sectors.The overall strategy for the

said sectors constitutes an integral part of the overall objective of promoting socio-economic inclusion and improve 
access to quality and sustainable services as well as diversifying the portfolio of skills of both refugees and host 
community. 
RRP partners will continue to advocate for reducing and eliminating restrictions to freedom of movement outside of 
the camps, enabling refugees to move freely within a designated territory with refugee identification documents. This 
will facilitate expansion of economic activities. Access to financial services will be enhanced and additional Loan and 
Business Associations will be established. RRP partners will stimulate demand and advocacy for Class M permits, 
which allows for recognized refugees and their spouse to be employed or engage in specific trade, business or 
profession, to be issued.Especially for big businesses in refugee areas and for refugee tertiary institution graduates. 
Strengthening Livelihoods & Resiliance 
RRP partners recognise the importance of close 
engagement with development actors in the South 
Sudan RRRP. Actors such as the World Bank and IFC are 
key stakeholders who can leverage their expertise to 
drive development priorities in a manner which will help 
build the resilience of refugees and the host community. 
KISEDP enables access to quality and sustainable basic 
and social services as well as promoting self-reliance 
and resilience not only for the South Sudanese refugees 
but also for the host communities. Blended efforts by 
Government of Kenya departments, RRP partners, the 
World Bank, IFC and other development partners 
facilitate access to agriculture development, promoting 
entrepreneurship and access to business opportunities, 
new technologies and trainings that are the foundation 
of resilient livelihoods for host and refugee communities. 
RRP partners’ cash based interventions in the shelter 
and WASH programmes help galvanize the Kakuma 
business eco-system resulting in the expansion of 
construction materials, hardware businesses, the need 
for masonry expertise and quarries for stones. 
Exponential growth can be realised when well-defined 
cash assistance programmes are linked to livelihood 
interventions. 
Inclusion of refugees in national social safety net 
programmes like the National Health Insurance Fund 
(NHIF) could also provide opportunities for channels to 
more sustainable approaches to targeting the most 
vulnerable refugees, in addition to providing cost 
effective social protection. 
Cognizant of human capacity development for 
supported communities and the evolving labour market 
needs, RRP partners will continue to further align the 
technical vocational education and training (TVET) with 
the market needs through equipping the refugees and 
host communities with the relevant competencies and 
life skills. 
RRP partners continue to work on financial inclusion of 
refugees and host communities into local banking 
institutions, as it will strengthen their position as 
potential investors, job creators and also contribute to 
their protection through the formalization/licensing of 
enterprises being set up. Key activities will include

attracting opportunities for business development and 
financial service provision, business acceleration, 
conducting market assessments and value-chain 
analysis, as well as improving skills profiling. 
Education community-based structures such as boards 
of management (BoMs) in schools, student councils, 
parent teacher associations, education management 
committees, foster child rights clubs, child protection 
volunteers and community based organisations (CBO) 
who will be actively involved in the implementation of 
education services will be supported to promote 
ownership and resilience. The Kenyan Ministry of 
Education (MoE) will be involved in monitoring the action 
to ensure adherence to Ministry guidelines and to 
enhance the quality of implementation throughout the 
duration of the response in line with the CRRF. Such 
structures will be constituted and operated as per MoE 
regulations. 
Partnership & Coordination 
Within the framework of the RRP response, the focus of the partnership structures will be on the partners who can 
facilitate the integration of services in the camps as well as the socio-economic inclusion of PoCs within the countyled 
systems. The government through the RAS and county authority are expected to take a lead in line with its 
mandate, supported by RRP partners, who will continue to provide the government with both technical and financial 
support to ensure efficient and fair government-owned protection and development processes. With the possible 
enactment of a new Refugee Law in 2019, RRP partners will work with the Government on the operationalisation of 
the law and the development of a Refugee Policy. 
Partnership with the county level government will be guided by the CRRF approach in order to ensure that 
beneficiaries have access to basic services. RRP partners will also support the Turkana County Government in the 
implementation of the County Integrated Development Plans (CIDP) and in this regard, technical assistance will be 
provided. 
RRP partners will also work with various coordination structures and technical working groups under various 
ministries including gender, child protection, education, youth and health to ensure the inclusion of refugees. 
Regionally, RRP partners will engage in the IGAD work on durable solutions in the region. Under the leadership of 
the Resident Coordinator’s Office, participation in the 2018-2022 UNDAF including in coordination, implementation, 
monitoring and reporting will be a key priority. RRP partners will also leverage technical support from other UN 
agencies, for the benefit of the operation and in line with the UNDAF work plans for all three pillars: economic, social 
and political. 
Partnership with private sector and development partners will be enhanced in order to improve services and financial 
inclusion services for refugees and host communities. The RRP partners will support project implementation under

the World Bank loans provided to the refugee-hosting countries. The implementation of the IFC Kakuma and 
Kalobeyei Challenge Fund commencing in late 2018 is expected to spur economic growth through the private sector 
and support to local entrepreneurs. 
The Kenya Comprehensive Refugee Programme (KCRP) will act as the coordination mechanism and will provide 
guidance on strategic programmatic issues as well as coordination of funding in the refugee programme. Interagency 
coordination meetings will be held regularly at Nairobi and at Sub-Office level including those on the 
implementation of the KISEDP. 
In line with the CRRF approach, RRP partners will restructure their implementation arrangements and work closely 
with the Government, deliver services directly through cash and implement through community-based organisations 
in addition to the established NGO partners.

Planned Response for 2019 & 
2020 
Protection 
All South Sudanese refugees will be registered coming from South Sudan or Uganda and they will be recognised on 
a prima facie basis by the government. During the process, they will be accommodated at the reception and transit 
centres in Nadapal, Kitale and Kakuma. All these centres should be ready for any emergency response in case of 
any influx from South Sudan. 
RRP partners are working to strengthen the early identification, mitigation and response mechanisms on SGBV and 
child protection activities together with national and county officials to have an Inter-Agency Mechanism on referral, 
prevention and response in terms of legal, health, physical protection and psychological support, as well as for 
alternative care arrangements. 
Building self-reliance and resilience of South Sudanese, especially targeting youth, the issuance of refugee ID cards 
by the Government needs to be prioritised so that refugees, including youth can access business/markets, skills 
training and engage in activities promoting social cohesion. The population will benefit from these activities during 
their stay in Kenya and also prepare them for any available durable solutions like resettlement and voluntary 
repatriation. 
RRP partners will work with national and county officials on strengthening their capacity on the response for child 
protection, youth and SGBV activities through formalising their activities through a memorandum of understanding, 
training officials, increasing the presence of Government staff in areas designated for refugees. In line with that, RRP 
partners will work with the RAS and county officials on community policing and peaceful co-existence activities with 
the host community, especially in relation to some ethnic groups from South Sudan who are in both Kenya and South 
Sudan. 
RRP partners will advocate for complementary pathway solutions like education scholarships and private and 
community sponsorship beyond solely the traditional resettlement option. RRP partners should be ready in 2019 and 
2020 for the possibility of facilitating voluntary repatriation depending on the implementation of the Peace 
Agreement.

K E N YA R R P F O R S O U T H S U DA N E S E > JA N UA R Y 2 0 1 9 - D E C EMB E R 2 0 2 0 15 
Education 
In line with CRRF and education (national and 
international) legislative and policy instruments, RRP 
partners will continue to advocate for and support the 
inclusion of refugee children into national education 
systems. Programme also benefit host community 
children. 
The planned response will also seek to enrol 30 per 
cent of children who are estimated to be out of school 
and improve the schooling situation for those who are 
enrolled but are learning in overcrowded classroom 
environments with insufficient numbers of trained 
teachers and scholastic materials. In this regard, 
additional classrooms, schools, desks, textbooks, 
teachers, WASH and play materials will be needed to 
address identified education supply and other 
constraints. 
Support will be provided for extra-curricular activities. 
Targeted interventions to improve participation of girls, 
over-age children and those with disabilities will also 
remain a key focus, as will the improvement of the 
quality of education data and information. 
Communities’ capacities will be developed and will be 
integral in the design, implementation and monitoring of 
education activities to ensure they remain invested in 
the education of their children and drive greater 
accountability in delivery of education services. 
Food security 
RRP partners providing food assistance to refugees helps to ensure that refugees and asylum seekers living in 
camps and settlements and host populations affected by natural and human-caused disasters have access to 
adequate food to meet their food and nutrition needs throughout the year. Refugees will be assisted throughout the 
2019-2020 as part of the Kenya Comprehensive Refugee Programme. 
RRP partners will continue to provide unconditional food assistance to refugees through in-kind and cash-based 
transfers. Cash-based transfers will progressively increase to meet up to 50 percent of food requirements by 2020. 
Meals will be provided in transit/reception centres, schools and vocational training centres. Specialised nutritional 
products will be used for the treatment and prevention of moderate acute malnutrition, in accordance with national 
protocols and in close coordination with government authorities and other RRP partners. 
The CRRF offers a conducive environment for fostering refugee self-reliance and reducing dependence on 
humanitarian assistance. So, while direct delivery of food and nutrition assistance to refugees will continue, activities 
to improve efficiencies and promote self-reliance among refugees and host communities will be expanded, building 
on experience generated in the Kalobeyei settlement. Refugee and host community traders will receive technical 
support to promote access to affordable and appropriate foods in markets and with thriving markets there is 
potential to move from blanket food assistance to targeted assistance.

16 KENYA R R P F O R S O U T H S U DA N E S E > JANUARY 2 0 1 9 - D E C E M B E R 2 0 2 0 
To generate opportunities for self-reliance for refugees and host communities, innovative assistance modalities that 
support livelihood diversification will be pursued. These will include the creation of rural productive assets on 
available land in camps and settlements, engagement with the retail market and access to financial services. 
While partners will continue to enhance efficiency, resource shortfalls will be managed through reductions in 
transfers either for all refugees or for all other than certain vulnerable groups, depending on assessments and 
inter-agency strategies. 
Health & Nutrition 
RRP partners will focus on the provision of 
comprehensive primary health care for both refugees 
and the surrounding host community members in 
Kakuma and Kalobeyei, while also ensuring access to 
life saving secondary and tertiary care. This will be 
guided by the provision of essential health care based 
on practical, scientifically sound, socially acceptable 
technology, made universally accessible to all within the 
community with their full participation, at a cost that the 
community and partners can sustain at every stage of 
their development, in the spirit of self-reliance and 
self-determination. 
Communicable diseases remain the main cause of 
morbidity and mortality within both Kakuma and 
Kalobeyei. There is hence a need to invest in a 
comprehensive preventive strategy to reduce outbreaks 
and cyclical increase in morbidity from communicable 
diseases such as watery diarrhoea and malaria. This will 
require an integrated vector control strategy, improved 
hygiene and sanitation while at the same time having a 
good disease surveillance system with early warning to 
inform preparedness and response plans. 
RRP partners will focus on HIV prevention, testing and 
treatment through increased awareness campaigns and 
ensuring appropriate care in close collaboration with the 
Ministry of Health. 
In order to improve the prospects of sustainable of 
access to quality health care services, RRP partners will 
pilot an National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) scheme 
in 2019. 
Nutrition interventions will not only focus on malnutrition 
caused by lack of enough calories but also by micro 
deficiencies due to an imbalanced dietary intake. This 
will require a multi sectoral approach to ensure 
interventions are nutrition sensitive. An increased part of 
this will be to use cash-based interventions coupled with 
intensive nutrition education to ensure beneficiaries are 
able to diversify their diet. 
The ever increasing need to provide quality services by 
ensuring provision of essential drugs, qualified and 
trained staff, well equipped facilities, access to 
specialised services will only be sustainable through 
integration of refugees into county and national health 
systems, including enrolment into the NHIF scheme, to 
support financing of health services for both host and 
refugee communities in both Kakuma and Kalobeyei.

Livelihoods & Resilience 
The overall livelihoods, energy and environment objective anticipates improved livelihoods, self-reliance and 
resilience-building for both refugees and host communities. Recognising the opportunity to link socio-economic 
opportunities for refugees with the Kenyan Government’s broader development agenda promotes socio-economic 
integration among refugees and the host community. 
Sectoral planned response in 2019-2020 will support longer-term development solutions for all. Market driven 
government certified vocational skills training courses will take place which will increase access to jobs in shelter, 
agriculture and clean energy programmes. Business development opportunities will be facilitated which will support 
participants’ financial inclusion through access to business loans; savings and transfer services to acquire livelihoods 
assets. RRP partners will support a broader set of reforms focusing on refugees’ access to legal documentation, 
improved social services and freedom of movement that promote trade and investment. 
RRP partners will focus on enhancing local, national and international private sector engagement to create market 
access opportunities; value chain integration; job matching; apprenticeships and internship placements. Major 
infrastructure developments for water and irrigation systems will be built to support agricultural production.

Shelter, Settlement & NFIs 
RRP partners will continue implementing the CBI approach through the conversion of transitional shelters to 
permanent shelters in Kalobeyei to achieve 48 per cent coverage in 2019 and 72 per cent in 2020. In line with the 
integration, the host community will be assisted with permanent shelters. All new arrivals will be provided with 
semi-permanent shelters, and people will be capacitated with skills for their construction, while PoCs with physical 
disabilities will be assisted. All new arrivals will be assisted with non-food items (NFIs) (new kit) while monthly NFIs 
(sanitary items) will continue through the CBI approach. 
In 2019 RRP partners will reduce the percentage of dilapidated shelters by repairing a significant number to improve 
the refugees’ security and living conditions. Through an inclusive assessment, affected households will receive 
shelter kits to repair their dilapidated shelters. 
In order to improve access to services and also markets, a section of 30km of roads will be constructed by the end of 
2020 in Kalobeyei (provided funding will be made available) to improve access conditions for the provision of 
services, including drainage networks and corresponding flood mitigation structures. Similarly, an estimated 32.5 km 
of roads will require rehabilitation through a Cash for Work’s integration approach with the community to ensure that 
these infrastructures are properly managed and maintained by the community. 
With the increase of refugees into the current settlement of Kalobeyei, the selection of a new site to be developed 
will be crucial. In this regard, RRP partners will strengthen engagement with the Turkana County and also build local 
communities capacity, and resilience to sustainably develop new processes and procedures to enhance the impact 
of trainings and ensure a smooth process of transition. 
Climate-smart farming technologies for agriculture and livestock production will be promoted and explored. RRP 
partners will try to expand access to wage-earning employment as well as self-employment and the right to engage 
in commercial activities individually and through CBO’s, groups and cooperatives. 
Interventions will be monetised (cash-based) to enable beneficiaries to make decisions about household spending 
and the purchase of productive assets. 
RRP partners will continue to stimulate accelerated progress towards safe access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, 
and modern energy services for all beneficiaries by 2020. RRP partners in close collaboration with the government 
and the private sector, are expected to increase access to sustainable energy from 20 per cent - 60per cent by 
2020. Alternatives to the current firewood provision to the beneficiaries will be gradually substituted with non-wood 
based fuels such as briquettes, biogas, Liquefied Petroleum Gas and Bioethanol. The private sector engagement will 
support the need for capital investment in energy in Kakuma and Kalobeyei. Cash Based Interventions will play a vital 
role in diversifying the availability of unconventional fuels in the Kakuma and Kalobeyei markets.

WASH 
RRP partners will continue the provision of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene services to PoCs and the host community 
in line with the CRRF Strategy. 
Concerted efforts geared towards improving the current sanitation situation in both Kakuma and Kalobeyei are 
aimed at improving the current household latrine coverage from 40 per cent to 65 per cent by constructing 6,000 
household latrines in 2019. CBIs for latrine construction will also be introduced in a phased approach. 
Piloting of Waste to Value Sanitation solutions is ongoing and this will be enhanced in 2019 through targeting of 
more households, thus increasing the quantity of briquettes produced and reducing operational costs to enhance 
the sustainability of the model. 
Hygiene promotion and environmental health will be escalated in 2019 in order to control cholera outbreaks. More 
hygiene promoters will be engaged in order to promote hygiene messages. 
WASH in schools will also be prioritised in order to address gaps with regard to sanitation. The development of the 
Water Master Plan for the Turkana West Sub County is progressing well. The implementation of the Master Plan will 
commence in 2019. More viable water supply sources including surface dams, rain water harvesting and rock 
catchments will be identified, constructed and effectively harnessed. This includes the design of a 4 million cubic 
meter multi-purpose dam on the upstream of the Tarach River for the purpose of domestic, agricultural and livestock 
use. The feasibility study and designs have been completed. Its construction is planned for 2020. Five boreholes 
were drilled in 2018 in order to stabilise the water supply in both Kakuma and Kalobeyei and these will be solarised 
and water piped to improve the per capita water available to beneficiaries. 
In order to maintain water quality standards, water quality monitoring will be enhanced through sampling of various 
water outlets across the camp and neighbouring host community villages. 
The RRP partners will closely work with the Turkana County Government in the development of facilities that are in 
line with KISEDP and the County CIDP.
