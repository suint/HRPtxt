Foreword - BURUNDI REGIONAL RRP 
Foreword 
As the Burundi refugee crisis approaches its fifth year, some 390,000 Burundian refugees are being 
generously hosted by the Governments and people of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, 
Tanzania and Uganda, 349,000 of whom are assisted through the Burundi Regional Refugee Response 
Plan. While smaller numbers of asylum seekers continue to arrive throughout the region, voluntary returns 
to Burundi have increased in the last year with more than 55,000 assisted to repatriate as of November 
2018. 
The situation in Burundi remains complex. Overall security has improved but significant human rights concerns persist, and the underlying 
political conflict that sparked the conditions causing people to flee remains unresolved. In this context, UNHCR and partners are not promoting 
refugee returns to Burundi, but are working with the governments involved to assist those who indicate they have made a free and informed 
choice to return voluntarily to do so in safety and dignify. 
In my travels I have had the privilege to sit with Burundian refugees – from Nduta Camp in Tanzania to Nakivale Settlement in Uganda, and from 
Mahama Camp in Rwanda to the Mulongwe site in the Democratic Republic of Congo – listening to their struggles, fears, and aspirations. Amidst 
all of the compelling individual stories, one thing is clear: the Burundi refugee population is diverse, and every person and family circumstance is 
different. Even as some refugees are opting to return home, the majority will still require international protection for some time to come. 
I regret that in 2018 the Burundi situation remained one of the least funded refugee crises in the world, the consequences of which were acutely 
felt with food cuts, lack of medicines, inadequate shelters, and overcrowded classrooms in countries of asylum. Refugees returning to Burundi, 
while by and large welcomed back, also faced food insecurity and a range of reintegration challenges. 
At the same time I salute all partners for remaining steadfast in their dedication to create more dignified living conditions and foster hope for 
both refugees and returnees, despite scarce resources and fading international attention. I thank the host governments and communities that 
have continued to welcome and provide refuge. 
And we extend our utmost appreciation to the donors who have supported our collective assistance efforts. We have recently made strides to 
better reflect your contributions, including both earmarked and un-earmarked funding in our funds tracking and communication materials. 
The 2019-2020 Burundi Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRRP) takes a comprehensive and solutions-oriented approach, with a continued 
emphasis on the inclusion of refugees in national systems, and integrated service delivery with host communities wherever possible. Greater 
self-reliance and the opportunity for refugees to contribute to their host countries remain the goals of socio-economic inclusion and livelihood 
activities. 
The emphasis on solutions is also reflected in the 2019 Joint Refugee Return and Reintegration Plan developed by inter-agency partners in 
Burundi, a summary of which has been included in this document alongside summaries of the respective Country Refugee Response Plans in 
order to more comprehensively present the full regional response. 
As we look forward to the era of implementation of the Global Compact on Refugees, informed by all of our experience to date in the application 
of the principles and goals of the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework in this region, let us work together to realise the promise of 
greater international responsibility sharing in the pursuit of comprehensive solutions for Burundian refugees.

Introduction - BURUNDI REGIONAL RRP 
Introduction 
1 There are a further 42,000 Burundian refugees from previous eras still residing in Tanzania who no longer receive assistance 
and are not included in the Regional or Country RRP. 
The 2019-2020 Burundi Regional Refugee Response 
Plan (RRRP) outlines the multi-agency response strategy 
and financial requirements of 35 partners supporting 
host governments to provide protection and assistance 
across the four main countries of asylum, as well as in 
Burundi for returning refugees. An expanded two-year 
timeframe, inclusion of impact on the host community, 
and the addition of several new partners, including 
UNDP and a number of local NGOs, are all reflective of 
efforts to make the 2019-2020 Burundi RRRP more 
comprehensive and solutions-oriented. 
In light of the number of overlapping refugee situations 
in the region, another new direction in 2019 is to 
emphasise Country Refugee Response Plans (CRRP), 
which articulate the multi-agency response for all 
refugee populations at the country level. In presenting a 
coherent approach to the Burundi refugee situation, this 
Regional RRP summarizes the elements of the Country 
RRPs that relate to the Burundi situation. 
Importantly, as the number of voluntary refugee returns 
to Burundi have become more significant in the last year, 
the 2019-2020 Regional RRP also summarizes the 2019 
Joint Refugee Return and Reintegration Plan (JRRRP) 
developed by inter-agency partners in Burundi. 
Tanzania continues to host the largest number of 
Burundian refugees with some 204,0001 as of October 
2018 living in the eastern part of the country in Ndutu, 
Mtendeli, and Nyarugusu camps. In Rwanda, most of the 
69,000 Burundian refugees reside in Mahama camp 
(58,000) while 11,000 live in urban areas. The DRC hosts 
42,000 Burundians in South Kivu, predominantly in the 
Lusenda and Mulongwe sites in South Kivu, with others 
living in communities in Katanga, Maniema, and North 
Kivu provinces. 34,000 Burundian refugees reside in 
Uganda, the vast majority in Nakivale settlement. 
In the pursuit of protection, assistance, and solutions for 
Burundian refugees, the 2019-2020 Regional RRP also 
takes into account the situation of and relationship with 
host communities. Resilience programming for both 
refugees and hosting communities will benefit targeted 
host community individuals, households, and 
communities, with the aim to conduct the humanitarian 
response in a manner that engages and strengthens 
national systems and local service delivery in refugee 
hosting areas. 
With the Inter-Burundi Dialogue convened under the 
auspices of the East African Community having made 
negligible progress in 2018, the underlying political 
conflict remains unresolved. Meanwhile, a Constitutional 
Referendum in May 2018, though marred by allegations 
of intimidation, arrests and forced disappearances, did 
not result in any significant increase in displacement. 
Presidential elections scheduled for 2020 mark the next 
major event on the political calendar. 
The September 2018 report by the UN Commission of 
Inquiry on Burundi states that serious human rights 
violations have persisted and the prolonged political 
crisis has had a negative impact on the socio-economic 
situation. Burundi’s economy remains seriously impacted 
by suspension of financial aid by major donors, shortage 
of foreign exchange reserves, price inflation, and 
declining investment.

Introduction - BURUNDI REGIONAL RRP 
The International Organization for Migration 
Displacement Tracking Matrix indicates that as of 
October 2018 approximately 147,000 people are 
internally displaced – 75 percent linked to natural 
disasters and 25 percent linked to socio-political factors 
– representing a 20 percent overall reduction in the last 
year. 
Although new refugee arrivals to neighbouring countries 
decreased in 2018, host countries still receive individuals 
claiming persecution, violence, harassment and fear, as 
well as a desire for family reunification, and food 
insecurity as reasons for their departure. At the same 
time, refugees opting to return home cite improved 
overall security, adverse conditions in countries of 
asylum, a desire to reoccupy their farmland, and family 
reunification. 
As of November 2018, more than 55,000 refugees have 
been assisted to return to Burundi – mostly from 
Tanzania, with additional numbers having returned both 
with assistance and on their own from Rwanda, the DRC, 
and Kenya. Current policy is not to promote returns to 
Burundi, but to assist those refugees who indicate they 
have made a free and informed choice to return 
voluntarily, to do so in safety and dignity. 
If recent trends continue, it is expected that the number 
of Burundian refugees in the four main countries of 
asylum will decrease by approximately half over the next 
two years. The 2019-2020 Regional RRP anticipates 
assisting a total of 394,000 Burundian refugees by the 
end of 2019, of whom 116,000 are projected to return to 
Burundi over the course of the year. In 2020, the 
Regional RRP includes 296,000 Burundian refugees, of 
whom 121,000 would return to Burundi and 175,000 
would remain in countries of asylum at the end of 2020.

Regional Protection and Solu tions Analysis - BURUNDI REGIONAL RRP 
Regional Protection and 
Solutions Analysis 
In 2018 the Governments of Rwanda, DRC, and Uganda 
maintained an open-door policy to Burundian refugees 
whereas access to Tanzanian territory was restricted 
with all border entry and reception points for Burundian 
asylum seekers officially closed. 
Rwanda continues to afford asylum seekers from 
Burundi prima facie recognition as refugees; all other 
countries apply individual or group refugee status 
determination procedures. Backlogs and delays 
notwithstanding, both Uganda and DRC have 
recognition rates for Burundians of more than 90 
percent. In Tanzania, where some 21,000 Burundian 
asylum applications are still pending, the recognition 
rate has been much lower. 
The presence of various armed actors in the DRC and 
rumours of both armed opposition and government of 
Burundi agents elsewhere in the region all indicate the 
need to maintain vigilance in preserving the civilian and 
humanitarian character of asylum. 
With children making up more than half of the Burundian 
refugee population and with significant numbers of 
unaccompanied and separated children, child protection 
services remain a key priority, including improving the 
ratio of caseworker to children. Protection of 
adolescents and youth also needs to be strengthened 
through targeted interventions. The main risks for 
children and youth include psychological distress, family 
separation, forced recruitment, child labour, physical 
violence, access to education, and sexual and genderbased 
violence. 
Women and girls are particularly exposed to a 
heightened risk of sexual and gender-based violence as 
a result of overcrowded shelters, traditional gender 
attitudes, and family separation. In 2018 Regional RRP 
partners provided support to 100 percent of identified 
sexual and gender-based violence survivors but lack of 
reporting the cases is still a problem and more attention 
is needed for prevention activities, including 
mainstreaming in other sectors. 
In the education sector the enrolment rate in primary 
schools at regional level was relatively high at 86 
percent at mid-year. However the quality of education is 
impacted by severely overcrowded classrooms with very 
limited equipment. The enrolment rate in secondary 
school is much lower in Tanzania and Uganda than in 
Rwanda and DRC, with a combined enrolment rate of 21 
percent in the region. 
Although steady progress has been made throughout 
the region in the transition from emergency to semipermanent 
shelter, especially in Rwanda, however nearly 
50 percent of refugees in Tanzania are still living in 
tents. The regular provision of household items including 
soap has suffered in the last year due to underfunding. 
All countries of asylum except Uganda saw reductions in 
food assistance at different times during the course of 
2018, impacting on the health and nutritional status of 
refugees. All Burundian refugees have access to health 
centres, but most are overcrowded and periodically run 
out of medicines and supplies. Global acute malnutrition 
rates were below emergency thresholds in all countries 
of asylum except the DRC.

Regional Protection and Solu tions Analysis - BURUNDI REGIONAL RRP 
Adequate quantities of clean water are generally 
available but gaps remain in access to sanitation 
facilities with the majority of households regionally still 
forced to use communal latrines, compounding risks of 
SGBV. 
Refugee presence has also placed stress on the natural 
resources of the host communities sometimes causing 
competition over water and tensions due to 
deforestation and other environmental issues. Initiatives 
to protect and restore the natural environment are 
necessary to foster social cohesions among refugees 
and host communities, as well as to halt environmental 
degradation in the region. 
In line with the Comprehensive Refugee Response 
Framework (CRRF) approach, many services are linked 
to national systems. An important next step is to 
maximise efficiency by promoting integrated service 
delivery and their inclusion in national and local plans 
and budgets, supported by bilateral and multi-lateral 
development assistance. 
Uganda, Rwanda, and DRC all have notably conducive 
policies to promote livelihoods and foster self-reliance, 
including the right to work and operate businesses. 
However, much more support and investment is needed 
to realise the potential that these policies would allow. 
Support is also needed to improve livelihood access for 
host communities in the region order to strengthen their 
resilience. 
Voluntary repatriation remains the most likely eventual 
solution for most Burundian refugees but freedom of 
choice in deciding whether and when to return must be 
respected. While the Government of Tanzania, from 
where the vast majority of Burundians are returning, 
continues to reaffirm its commitment to the voluntary 
nature of returns, refugees do express feeling pressure 
to leave. Regional RRP partners have been actively 
working to verify voluntariness and ensure protection 
safeguards are in place. 
Referrals of Burundians for resettlement are generally 
low given the relatively recent arrival of the majority of 
the Burundian refugee population. Complementary 
pathways for admission to third countries could offer an 
alternative approach but remain largely unexplored for 
the Burundian refugee population.

Regional Response Strategy and Priorities - BURUNDI REGIONAL RRP 
Regional Response Strategy and 
Priorities 
Regional Objectives 
The 35 partners in the 2019-2020 Burundi Regional RRP aim to work with host governments to improve the 
protection environment and meet the basic needs of refugees including food, adequate shelter, sanitation, and 
education, while continuing to promote livelihoods and socio-economic inclusion with host communities, and placing 
a greater emphasis on resilience and solutions. 
The 2019-2020 RRRP for the Burundi situation is guided by six regional strategic objectives: 
1. Burundian refugees enjoy unhindered access to asylum, are able to access fair, impartial and efficient RSD 
procedures, are fully documented, and enjoy a favourable protection environment in host countries and upon 
return. 
2. Protection systems are strengthened to ensure Burundian refugees and returnees are able to enjoy their full 
rights, specifically with regard to safety and security, child protection, sexual and gender-based violence, and 
community-based protection. 
3. Burundian refugees, returnees and all affected persons access essential services with progressive inclusion in 
national health, education, social protection and other services. 
4. Peaceful co-existence and social cohesion between host communities and refugees, as well as for returnees in 
their home communities, is supported, including through protection of the natural environment. 
5. Refugees and returnees transition from aid dependence towards self-reliance and resilience, with the capacity 
and opportunity to contribute to the economic development of their host/home communities while in countries of 
asylum and upon return to Burundi – breaking the dependency cycle and restoring control and dignity to their 
lives. 
6. Comprehensive solutions for Burundian refugees are progressively achieved. 
To complement these overarching regional objectives, there are ten core sectors of the RRRP for which harmonised 
regional indicators have been developed and against which the refugee response is measured including: protection 
(including child protection and sexual and gender-based violence); education; energy and the environment; food 
security; health and nutrition; livelihoods; shelter; water and sanitation, and solutions. 
A cross-cutting priority will be to implement cash-based initiatives to afford greater dignity and independence for 
refugees as well as an improvement in socio-economic conditions for both refugees and the surrounding host 
communities.

Regional Response Strategy and Priorities - BURUNDI REGIONAL RRP 
In line with the Global Compact on Refugees, partners will work collaboratively toward refugee inclusion, integrated 
services, and self-reliance, pursuing financial inclusion and synergies with development initiatives. 
Regional partners will work with governments to link the refugee response with international development actors to 
support capacity development and improved social service infrastructure. 
Regional Protection Framework 
Regional RRP partners will continue advocacy and capacity building with concerned governments for access to 
territory and asylum, fair and efficient refugee status determination procedures, maintaining the civilian and 
humanitarian character of asylum, non-refoulement and voluntariness of return. Where possible, the protection 
response will include efforts to remove or modify restrictions on refugee movement. 
Protection monitoring at borders will be required in order to enable evidence-based advocacy and appropriate 
programmatic responses. In Burundi, returnee protection monitoring will be reinforced. 
Response partners will continue to work toward creating a rights-based protection environment, expand 
programmes targeting refugees and returnees with specific protection needs, and reinforce both individual case 
management and community-based prevention and response mechanisms including specifically for child protection 
and SGBV. 
THE GLOBAL COMPACT ON REFUGEES AND THE APPLICATION OF COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSES 
In 2016, all 193 Member States of the United Nations adopted the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, 
and its Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF), to strengthen international responsibility sharing in 
situations of large movements of refugees and protracted refugee situations. The New York Declaration set in motion 
preparations for the Global Compact on Refugees, informed by the practical application of comprehensive responses 
and a broad range of consultations, which the General Assembly adopted on 17 December 2018. 
With the CRRF as an integral part, the Global Compact on Refugees proposes a range of global and context-specific 
measures for applying comprehensive responses in more systematic and sustainable ways, as outlined in its 
programme of action. As with the CRRF itself, the objectives of the Compact are to: (i) ease pressures on host 
countries; (ii) enhance refugee self-reliance; (iii) expand access to third country solutions; and (iv) support conditions 
in countries of origin for return in safety and dignity. 
Regional and country refugee response plans contribute to the implementation of the Global Compact on Refugees 
by articulating prioritized multi-stakeholder responses for the benefit of refugees and host communities, identified 
together with governments and partners. Among countries affected by the Burundi refugee crisis, Rwanda and 
Uganda are already officially applying the CRRF, as of end-2018, while the strategy outlined in this RRRP reinforces 
the implementation of comprehensive responses in line with the Compact throughout all countries of its coverage in 
2019.

Regional Response Strategy and Priorities - BURUNDI REGIONAL RRP 
The protection risks faced by youth and adolescents will be addressed through targeted interventions – especially in 
sustainable livelihoods, marketable vocational training, and skills development. 
The regional response will aim to integrate the rights of persons with disabilities, addressing the barriers they face to 
accessing protection and assistance. 
Community-based protection, livelihoods, education, and environmental protection programmes will be designed to 
involve host communities in order to promote social cohesion and contribute toward a better protection 
environment. 
All response partners will have measures in place to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA). 
Strengthening Livelihoods and Self reliance 
To foster economic self-reliance for refugees and host communities, Regional RRP partners will work toward 
strengthening resilience across the region, emphasizing economic inclusion and utilising cash-based interventions 
wherever feasible. 
In the DRC, the feasibility of a cash or voucher system is being systematically assessed to support access to basic 
goods and services while also promoting self-reliance, enabling households to spend it on household needs, or 
invest in livelihood strategies according to their own priorities. Enhancing purchasing power also has the potential to 
contribute to the local economy and strengthen peaceful coexistence. 
In Rwanda a key priority will be strengthening livelihoods and self-reliance by scaling up interventions that are more 
sustainable and cost effective. To achieve this, the joint Government- UNHCR Economic Inclusion Strategy, currently 
under review, will be a key instrument to focus more on market-based livelihood interventions for both farming and 
business. RRP partners will explore opportunities to support entrepreneurial development, particularly for women 
and youth. 
Despite Uganda’s progressive approach to refugee management, the vast majority of refugees remain dependent 
on international aid. In this regard, priority outcomes for the improvement of livelihoods in Uganda will be access to 
short-term employment opportunities especially in areas such as agricultural production, afforestation measures and 
labour-intensive public works. 
RRP partners in Tanzania will focus on an integrated approach toward resilience and livelihoods that includes both 
refugee and host populations as the Kigoma region is in great need of socio-economic development. The United 
Nations Kigoma Joint Programme aims to establish more long-term projects in this regard.

Partership and Coordination - BURUNDI REGIONAL RRP 
Expanding Solutions 
The 2019-2020 Burundi Regional RRP includes a greater focus on comprehensive solutions in line with the Global 
Compact on Refugees and its objectives. In addition to the traditional solutions of voluntary repatriation, formal local 
integration, and third country resettlement, the RRRP emphasizes socio-economic inclusion as a means to empower 
refugees to be both productive while living in countries of asylum, and better prepared to take advantage of other 
solutions. 
While not promoting returns to Burundi, RRRP partners will assist those who indicate they have made a free and 
informed choice to return voluntarily, by ensuring protection safeguards are in place, and providing transport and 
return packages in line with the 2019 Joint Refugee Return and Reintegration Plan. 
Third country resettlement will remain a critical option for certain Burundian refugees who face serious protection 
concerns in the region. Complementary pathways to admission will be more proactively pursued, including exploring 
opportunities for family reunification, labour mobility, and education both in the region and globally. 
Partership and Coordination 
In close collaboration with host governments, UNHCR leads and coordinates the response to the Burundi refugee 
situation in each affected country following the Refugee Coordination Model (RCM). Technical meetings are 
organized by sector at the local level and also in the respective capitals. 
The Regional Child Protection Network (RCPN), coordinated by UNHCR, and the Education in Emergencies Network 
(EiEN), coordinated by UNHCR and Save The Children, are interagency networks convened in Nairobi with partners 
who are working across the region, to support cohesive, interagency child protection and education responses at 
the field-level through technical support, capacity building, promotion of learning, joint analysis, and advocacy. 
The coordination of cash transfers in each country will proceed through joint assessment, monitoring, and a 
dedicated working group to determine the best transfer mechanisms and ensure linkages with different sectors. 
Since 2017, the Regional Refugee Coordinator (RRC)/Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework Champion for 
the Burundi situation has been working with the UNHCR Representatives in Burundi, the DRC, Rwanda, Tanzania 
and Uganda to ensure an overarching vision and coherent inter-agency engagement across the region in pursuit of 
protection and solutions for Burundian refugees. In doing so, the RRC works at the regional level to facilitate 
strategic, planning, and operational synergies and ensure collaboration among Governmental, UN system, Non- 
Governmental Organisations, donors, civil society partners, private sector, and other stakeholders. 
Joint advocacy and resource mobilization for the 2019-2020 RRRP will continue to be areas of focus for the RRC with 
inter-agency partners.

THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO - COUNTRY RRP SUMMARY 
TANZANIA 
Background 
Some 42,000 Burundian refugees reside in the DRC as of 31 October 2018 with the vast majority living in camps, 
communities or urban areas within the South Kivu province. Despite the complex security environment in areas 
hosting refugees in South Kivu, the overall protection environment for Burundian refugees improved in 2018. In 
addition to the existing Lusenda site, a new refugee site of Mulongwe opened in late 2017 which aims at 
encouraging self-reliance and community participation from its inception. 
The right of freedom of movement is generally guaranteed in the DRC. The government has identified secure areas 
(camps or settlements) where refugees can access regular assistance. The government does not prevent refugees 
who choose to do so from settling in host communities, provided these are sufficiently far from the border and do not 
pose a security threat for refugees themselves, or for the host community. The socio-economic situation in most of 
the rural zones hosting refugees is poor, with little access to basic services, and very few employment opportunities. 
Most Burundian refugees depend on RRP partners’ assistance for food, education, health care and water, sanitation 
and hygiene services, despite having access to land in rural areas. Progress towards supporting self-reliance among 
refugees has been hampered by lack of funding and by a paucity of experienced partners willing to engage in 
isolated areas. With limited resources available, focus is almost exclusively on delivery of assistance, delaying plans 
for a more robust approach toward solutions and self-reliance. 
Although the DRC has not to date formally initiated the application of the CRRF, many elements of this response are 
consistent with its approach. These include the very few restrictions placed on refugees and their access to those 
services functioning in hosting areas as well as to the labour market; application of the out-of-camp policy; the 
availability of irrigable land for crop cultivation; and promotion of a culture of self-reliance in all aspects of refugees’ 
lives. The RRP in 2019-2020 will emphasise relationships with development and peacebuilding partners to improve 
services for all who reside in hosting areas.

THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO - COUNTRY RRP SUMMARY 
Needs Analysis 
Burundian refugees in Lusenda camp and its extensions are living in overcrowded conditions, increasing the risk of 
communicable disease outbreaks. There are a lack of drugs to treat even the most common illnesses. In the water 
and sanitation sector, water provision is below standards with only 18 litres per person per day and 45 percent of the 
population are still in need of latrines. 
Refugees face multiple protection risks, which are heightened due to the general insecurity and the lack of a 
functional security sector. Sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) is endemic in DRC and in the refugee sites is 
compounded by the weak justice system, low participation of women in decision making processes, lack of 
livelihoods and education opportunities, the practice of survival sex, impunity for perpetrators, low participation of 
communities in the prevention of SGBV and constant need to traverse isolated areas to collect firewood. 
Overall, refugees are dependent on multi-sectoral assistance for survival but also require increased access to 
livelihood opportunities to strengthen their resilience and self-reliance. 
Response Strategy and Priorities 
In 2019 – 2020 RRP partners in the DRC will focus on promoting a favourable protection environment while 
strengthening emphasis on durable solutions, resilience and empowerment in order to gradually reduce assistance 
and support a more community-based response. Although not formally a ‘CRRF country,’ RRP partners have already 
started implementing strategies, policies and plans in support of refugees and host communities, in line with 
comprehensive responses and advancing the implementation of the Global Compact on Refugees. Efforts have 
been made to include refugees in development plans. RRP partners will focus on the following objectives: 
1. Preserve equal and unhindered access to territorial asylum and international protection, promoting the full 
enjoyment of rights, and the civilian character of asylum. 
2. Improve the protection and solutions environment through stronger links to developing national systems and 
services through development and government partners, including police and the justice, health and education, 
land management and others necessary for community-based responses, self-reliance, and progression towards 
the full enjoyment of rights. 
3. Achieve minimum standards in the provision of multi-sectoral assistance to refugees and host communities with a 
view to anchor the response in government systems; development plans; multi-year strategies; and regional 
protection frameworks and policies – paying particular attention to the needs of children and women. 
4. Promote social cohesion and peaceful co-existence between refugees and host communities through the 
implementation of targeted self-reliance and resilience programmes and respect for the natural environment.

THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO - COUNTRY RRP SUMMARY 
5. Foster economic self-reliance and durable solutions for refugees and host communities by expanding the use of 
cash, reducing the dependency of humanitarian aid and promoting social economic growth in line with national 
and development plans. 
Partnership and Coordination 
Working in accordance with the Refugee Coordination Model, coordination is managed under the leadership of the 
Commission Nationale pour les Réfugiés (CNR) with UNHCR playing a key supporting role. 
Partnerships with stakeholders beyond the humanitarian community, including Government, donors, UN agencies, 
development agencies, non-governmental organizations, civil society, private sector, and research institutions, will be 
pursued in order to ensure sustainable responses that have a meaningful impact. 
RRP partners will participate in the Local and Provincial Development Plan and will advocate for the inclusion of 
areas that host refugees in the update of the Government’s five year plan (2018-2022). Consultations to further 
strengthen comprehensive responses in line with the Global Compact on Refugees and defining the next steps to 
advance multi-year, multi-stakeholder approaches are foreseen with national authorities. 
In December 2018, a Country Refugee Response Plan was developed for DRC, laying out the inter-agency 2019- 
2020 assistance strategy for all refugees and returnees in the country, in support of the government.

RWANDA - COUNTRY RRP SUMMARY 
Background 
As of October 2018, there are some 69,000 Burundian refugees registered in Rwanda. Of these, 58,000 reside in 
Mahama camp, which consists of two sites. Another 11,000 live in urban areas, mostly in Kigali and Huye. There are 
four reception centres to receive new arrivals who are recognised as refugees on a prima facie basis. 
Rwanda generally provides a favourable protection environment with de facto right to work, open borders and a high 
level commitment that all durable solutions should be made available. Access to core protection services such as 
registration, legal assistance, community-based protection and SGBV prevention and support are key priorities as 
well as ensuring that refugees have access to basic services. Rwanda officially initiated the application of the CRRF 
in March 2018 and all responses are in line with this protection and solutions approach. 
Needs Analysis 
Sexual and gender-based violence is a key concern; incidents are underreported and often result in unwanted 
pregnancies, school dropouts and stigmatisation, putting survivors at further risk of exposure to negative coping 
mechanisms like survival sex, begging, etc. Programmatic gaps in other sectors such as overcrowding of shelters or 
lack of safe energy also contribute to the risk of SGBV. 
Child protection concerns include neglect, of which 20 percent of children are estimated to be affected, child labour, 
child marriage and domestic violence. 
Limited livelihood opportunities are compounded by inadequate levels of farming land, limited trade between the 
camp and host communities, lack of appropriate documentation, and limited access to financial services. 
Overall assistance is required to meet basic needs, including: shelter; WASH; food; health; education, and nutrition.

RWANDA - COUNTRY RRP SUMMARY 
Response Strategy and Priorities 
In line with the CRRF approach, strategic areas for the 2019-2020 refugee response by the 15 RRP partners are: 
1. Continue to ensure reception, protection and assistance for all persons of concern, including new arrivals, with 
targeted assistance for vulnerable persons with specific needs and a community-based approach; 
2. Advocacy and strategic development partnerships for inclusion of all refugees in national systems in particular 
health and education, in line with Government policy; 
3. Increase refugee livelihood opportunities through targeted assistance based on needs, vulnerabilities and 
capacities. 
A key focus will be to support the government in its development efforts that lead to promotion of socio-economic 
growth, access to livelihood opportunities especially in urban areas, and strengthening of partnerships with the 
private sector. 
Assistance will be targeted based on needs, vulnerabilities and capacities of refugees, rather than the provision of 
blanket assistance. In line with the Government policy of integrating refugees into national systems, a key priority will 
be to ensure integration of services for refugees with the existing services, especially at the district level, promoting 
equity in service delivery for refugees and host communities. 
An important avenue to provide refugees with greater choice in meeting their needs will be shifting to cash-based 
interventions for food assistance. This will be based on feasibility studies and response analysis, with the objective of 
making gains in efficiency and effectiveness while assessing the impact on local markets and communities and 
mitigating protection risks. 
Partnership and Coordination 
The refugee response in Rwanda is led and coordinated by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugees 
(MIDIMAR) and UNHCR at the capital and field levels. Refugee Coordination Meetings (RCM), including sector 
specific working groups, are regularly held at the capital and field levels. 
In December 2018, a Country Refugee Response Plan was developed for Rwanda, laying out the inter-agency 
2019-2020 assistance strategy for all refugees and returnees in the country, in support of the Government of 
Rwanda.

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA - COUNTRY RRP SUMMARY 
Background 
1 There are a further 42,000 Burundian refugees from previous eras still residing in Tanzania who no longer receive assistance 
and are not included in the Regional or Country RRP. 
The Burundi Regional RRP covers some 204,0001 Burundian refugees hosted by the United Republic of Tanzania in 
refugee camps in the northwest of the country as of 31 October 2018. 
Since 2017, restrictions on access to territory and asylum have increased. Burundian refugees have to undergo 
individual refugee status determination, with a current backlog of some 21,000 asylum seekers. All 19 border entry 
and reception points for both Burundian and Congolese asylum seekers were closed by July 2018. 
Despite an unpredictable protection environment and limited capacity and resources to stabilise and strengthen 
existing programmes RRP partners in Tanzania continue to provide protection and assistance to refugees. 
A Tripartite Commission comprised of the Governments of Tanzania and Burundi, and UNHCR has held two meetings 
since September 2017. The Tripartite Commission acknowledged that while some refugees may opt to return, others 
may still have well founded reasons to remain in Tanzania and will continue to be in need of international protection. 
While voluntary repatriation is not being promoted, returnees are being assisted based on principles of voluntariness 
and so that returns can take place in safety and dignity.

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA - COUNTRY RRP SUMMARY 
Needs Analysis 
Burundian refugees remain highly dependent on humanitarian assistance. 
A lack of identity documents makes it difficult for refugees to access basic services and there is growing concern for 
refugee children born in Tanzania without birth certificates. Child protection needs persist with inadequate numbers 
of child friendly spaces, lack of capacity to monitor children in foster care and continued risks of SGBV and forced 
early marriages. 
In the education sector school dropout rates are high, less than 10 percent of secondary school-aged children are 
enroled and classrooms are overcrowded with shortages of trained teachers. 
Major gaps in sanitation and hygiene continue and soap distribution remains inadequately low at 250g/person/ 
month. 
Needs persist across all the sectors due to chronic underfunding and the Government’s restrictive policies around 
refugee freedom of movement and economic activities. 
Response Strategy and Priorities 
In 2019-2020, Country RRP partners will undertake a multifaceted response to the complex and evolving protection 
environment in Tanzania that ensures access to territory, humanitarian assistance and opportunities for durable 
solutions and self-reliance. Building on the initiatives and revising some of the approaches launched in 2018, the 
focus will be on the following strategic objectives: 
1. Preserve equal and unhindered access to territorial asylum and protection, promote the full enjoyment of rights, 
and maintain the civilian character of asylum; 
2. Enable access to essential services according to minimum international standards and ensure protection systems 
are strengthened and refugees and returnees are able to enjoy their full rights, specifically in regard to safety and 
security, child protection, protection from SGBV, and community-based protection; 
3. Enhance peaceful co-existence and social cohesion between host communities and refugees, including through 
protection of the natural environment; 
4. Ensure refugees have access to comprehensive solutions.

UGANDA - COUNTRY RRP SUMMARY 
Background 
Burundian refugees make up the third largest population group of refugees hosted by Uganda with some 34,000 as 
of the end of October 2018. The vast majority reside in Nakivale settlement in Isingiro district. Since June 2017, new 
arrivals from Burundi have had to undergo individual refugee status determination. 
Uganda generally has a favourable protection environment which allows for freedom of movement, right to work or 
to establish a business and access to national services. Through its Settlement Transformative Agenda (STA) Uganda 
pursues a non-encampment policy for refugee protection and assistance. Building on its inclusive policies, Uganda 
has embraced the CRRF approach in follow-up to the New York Declaration, serving also as a basis for advancing the 
STA. 
For the first time in Uganda’s history, national and local development plans will include refugee issues. In March 
2018, the Ministry of Education introduced its education response plan with the aim of responding to the additional 
strain placed on the educational system in refugee hosting districts. The Ministry of Water and the Ministry of Health 
have also begun developing integrated response plans. 
In line with the Grand Bargain commitment to improve joint and impartial needs assessments, a joint inter-agency 
multi-sector needs assessment of refugees and host communities was carried out in refugee hosting districts to 
provide evidence-based data for the development of the 2019-2020 RRP.

UGANDA - COUNTRY RRP SUMMARY 
Needs Analysis 
Despite Uganda’s progressive approach to refugee management, refugees risk remaining vulnerable and becoming 
dependent on humanitarian assistance if interventions do not adequately focus on sustainable and resilient 
livelihoods going forward. Challenges include insufficient land for producing food, lack of seeds, tools and access to 
capital. 
Dependency on natural resources for energy and shelter materials leads to cutting of trees, contributing to 
environmental degradation and increased risk of SGBV for women and children. The provision of clean energy as 
well as reforestation and afforestation is crucial. 
Persistently low enrolment and attendance rates for both refugee and host community children and alarming 
indicators of 154 pupils per classroom and 85 pupils per teacher highlight the continued needs in the education 
sector. 
Response Strategy and Priorities 
Under the leadership and coordination of the Government, the Uganda 2019-2020 RRP aims at achieving the 
following objectives, in line with the Uganda Multi-Year Multi-Partner Protection and Solutions Strategy (2016 -2020): 
1. Uganda’s asylum space is maintained, equal and unhindered access to territory is preserved and the 
government’s emergency preparedness and response capacity is progressively strengthened. 
2. The Government of Uganda owns protection processes that promote the full enjoyment of rights, and international 
protection standards throughout the displacement cycle are efficient and fair. 
3. By 2020, the refugee response paradigm in Uganda has progressively shifted from care and maintenance to 
inclusion and self-reliance through development of individual capacities and the promotion of a conducive 
environment for livelihoods opportunities. 
4. By 2020, refugees progressively benefit from provision of inclusive basic social services, including health, 
education, child protection, water and sanitation, provided by national authorities in refugee hosting districts. 
5. By 2020, refugees are well on their path to access durable solutions. They are either able to return voluntarily to 
their countries of origin, or have found third country solutions, or start attaining socio-economic opportunities 
similar to hosting communities in Uganda, including ability to exercise their full range of rights.

UGANDA - COUNTRY RRP SUMMARY 
Partnership and Coordination 
OPM provides the over-arching policy and coordination framework of the refugee response in Uganda, including the 
CRRF Steering Group and Secretariat that serve to advance a whole-of-government, multi-stkaehoder approach. 
Operational coordination takes place within the framework of a refugee coordination structure dedicated specifically 
to refugee-hosting areas: 
¦¦ Leadership level: co-led by the Uganda Government (OPM), and UNHCR; 
¦¦ Inter-agency, country level (UN and development partner operational focal points, NGO country directors): 
co-led by the Uganda Government (OPM and MoLG) and UNHCR; 
¦¦ Technical sector level: co-led by Government, UN and NGO partners for each sector 
¦¦ District/settlement level (inter-agency and sector structures): OPM, DLGs, and UNHCR co-chair. 
Under the overall leadership of OPM, the role of line Ministries and district authorities in the coordination of the 
refugee response will be further strengthened in 2019-2020. Sector working groups of the refugee response will 
align with Government sector groups under the National Development Plan (NDP). The refugee Education, Health 
and WASH sector working groups have already piloted this approach and are co-chaired by line Ministries. This will 
ensure that refugees and refugee-hosting areas are increasingly integrated in the NDP.

BURUNDI RETURNS - JOINT REFUGEE RETURN AND REPATRIATION PLAN SUMMARY 
Background 
In 2017 and 2018 increasingly significant numbers of Burundian refugees have chosen to return to the country. While 
voluntary repatriation is an important solution for those refugees ready to exercise this fundamental right, Burundian 
refugee returns are taking place in a context of socio-economic fragility, requiring a much greater investment in their 
sustainability. 
Since September 2017, more than 55,000 refugees have been assisted to return to Burundi, the vast majority from 
Tanzania, with smaller numbers having returned from Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Kenya. With 
the original political crisis still not fully resolved, UNHCR and partners are not promoting returns to Burundi, but are 
providing assistance to those refugees who indicate they have made a free and informed choice to repatriate. 
The 2019 Burundian Joint Refugee Return and Reintegration Plan (JRRRP) is an integrated response catering for 
immediate humanitarian and longer-term resilience and reintegration needs of Burundian refugees who voluntarily 
repatriate from Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, and Kenya. The 2019-2020 Burundi 
Regional RRP and 2019 JRRRP together anticipate the voluntary repatriation of some 116,000 Burundian refugees in 
2019: 96,000 from Tanzania; 10,000 from the DRC; 5,000 from Rwanda; 4,000 from Uganda; and 1,000 from Kenya. 
In the current political, social and economic context in Burundi, the sustainable return of Burundian refugees requires 
humanitarian and development stakeholders to work together to create an environment conducive to the full 
enjoyment of rights for returnees while promoting social cohesion and strengthening resilience in communities of

BURUNDI RETURNS - JOINT REFUGEE RETURN AND REPATRIATION PLAN SUMMARY 
Needs Analysis 
While returnee protection monitoring in Burundi indicates that returnees have not been subject to any pattern of 
discrimination in exercising their rights because of their status as returnees, they do face a number of socioeconomic 
reintegration challenges that have informed the development of the 2019 JRRRP. 
These challenges include access to shelter with 49 percent of returnees reporting they do not have access to their 
old homes, with 32 percent staying with friends or family upon their return. 76 percent of returnees also face 
challenges accessing their land upon return due to a variety of reasons, including temporary occupation by family 
members in their absence (35 percent), and land disputes (13 percent). 
Returnee children report difficulty re-enrolling in school mid-year with 72 percent of older children (12-17 years old) 
and 42 percent of younger children (6-11 years old) out of school at the time they were visited. Tens of thousands of 
children born in exile have returned without Birth Certificates. While 72 percent of returnees have access to health 
services, many of the health centres lack personnel and adequate supplies. 
With 15 percent of the Burundian population facing acute food insecurity, the arrival of returnees to some of the most 
impacted areas will increase pressure and requires assistance with nutritional and agricultural support. Access to 
land, support with livelihoods and rebuilding resilience for returnees and their home communities will be important to 
ensure return is sustainable. 
As the number of returns increase, expanded protection monitoring of returnee areas is needed to ensure that 
human rights are respected and identify protection risks for the purpose of informing effective responses. 
Response Strategy & Priorities 
The overall goal of the 2019 Burundi JRRRP is to uphold the exercise of the right of return for Burundian refugees 
and further their socio-economic reintegration without discrimination. 
In collaboration with the Burundian authorities, partners of the 2019 Burundian Joint Refugee Return and 
Reintegration Plan will work to meet the following objectives, while building long-term resilience, and with priority 
attention to women, children, youth and marginalised people: 
1. Ensure a dignified and efficient reception of returnees including registration, profiling, support at the border and 
the transit centres, transport, as well as the provision of immediate assistance for the most vulnerable. 
2. Ensure that rights of returnees are respected and monitored.

BURUNDI RETURNS - JOINT REFUGEE RETURN AND REPATRIATION PLAN SUMMARY 
3. Create a safe environment and ensure access to essential services including food, safe and adequate shelter, 
water and sanitation, health and nutrition, education, and protection as well as critical infrastructure and incomegenerating 
and self-reliance opportunities. This includes supporting service provision in the communities of return. 
4. Ensure durable solutions for displacement-affected populations, including IDPs, in the areas of return. 
5. Support and reinforce existing social capital assets that can facilitate mediation and conflict resolution efforts for 
the peaceful coexistence of communities. 
The planned response for 2019 will focus on the main of areas of return in the provinces of Makamba, Ruyigi, 
Kirundo, and Muyinga. Intervention will be undertaken in two realms: the emergency phase for new arrivals within 
the first months of return, and longer-term resilience oriented community-based support.

Partnership and Coordination 
The JRRRP has 18 partners operating in Burundi including Government entities, UN agencies, and several NGOs, 15 
of whom have submitted financial requirements for this plan. 
UNHCR is the lead agency coordinating the reception of repatriation convoys in partnership with the Repatriation, 
Reintegration and Reinsertion department in the office of the Ministry of Interior. The same department manages the 
coordination of returnee reintegration with the support of the UN Agencies, amongst them UNDP (as the lead), 
UNHCR (as the co-lead) and NGOs. 
In addition, the Durable Solutions Technical Working Group established under the auspices of the Ministry for Human 
Rights Gender and Social Affairs has developed an Action Plan which also encompasses reintegration objectives. 
This forum provides another platform to coordinate coherent and sustainable reintegration. 
Relevant Government line ministries responsible for health, education, environment, agriculture, and employment are 
also engaged. Enhanced synergy between relevant line ministries and humanitarian and development actors at 
national, provincial, and communal level is required and will be pursued.
