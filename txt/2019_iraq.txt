As the country gradually transformed from a nation gripped by the armed conflict against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) to one where normal life was slowly but surely resuming, the humanitarian community in Iraq had to evolve as well. Whereas the response in recent years had been focused on the immediate life-saving needs of those fleeing ISIL, in 2018, vulnerable Iraqis began to show differentiated needs: those in protracted displacement with no immediate prospects of returning home; those who had returned home but found there was a lack of security or services; and those who wanted to return home but found they could not for a variety of reasons. Humanitarian actors were required to respond accordingly. In parallel, political and ethno-sectarian changes were also underway in the country, adding an additional level of uncertainty to humanitarian programming.The year ahead promises to also be complex, but due to several emerging data sets, the humanitarian community has a better grasp of the challenges which it will face in serving the people of Iraq. Out of an estimated 6.7 million people in need, the humanitarian system will target 1.75 million, a population which includes both in-camp and out-of-camp IDPs, returnees, and vulnerable host communities. We will seek $701 million to carry out operations falling under three Strategic Objectives: (1) post-conflict transition towards durable solutions; (2) ensuring the centrality of protection; and (3) strengthening contingency planning and preparedness. Iraq’s approximately 1.8 million remaining internally displaced persons must be presented with options beyond life in an IDP camp, and the international community—in partnership with the Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government—must begin preparing for this eventuality. However, it is becoming more obvious each day that certain groups will need extra support if they are ever to make the transition back to their communities—among these groups, families with perceived affiliations to extremist organizations are among the most vulnerable. All of this will be implemented in a country that is prone to a daunting set of environmental challenges and natural hazards, including floods, earthquakes and droughts. Humanitarians and their government counterparts must undertake collective preparedness and contingency planning to meet identifiable risks which could impact the realization of our humanitarian mandate.As the overall number of IDPs in Iraq continued to decrease during 2018—from an overall high of 6 million at the height of the conflict to an estimated 1.8 million now—the closure and consolidation of IDP camps became an operational priority for both the government and the United Nations. The humanitarian community has an obligation to ensure that minimum standards are maintained, and camps with poor infrastructure in remote locations which host a limited number of families are not efficient or effective at serving the needs of IDPs. Thus, camp consolidation and the transfer of IDPs to larger camps with better service provision—including medical services, schools and improved security arrangements—is one of the goals of humanitarian actors in Iraq in 2019. However, in keeping with the Strategic Objective of ensuring the centrality of protection, the UN will continue to advocate that all such activities are safe, dignified, informed, voluntary and sustainable.It is a privilege to be serving here in Iraq when the country is at a critical crossroads. Together with United Nations agencies, NGO partners and government counterparts, I will renew my dedication to ensuring that vulnerable Iraqis are able to access the assistance they need to continue rebuilding their lives. Ms. Marta RuedasHumanitarian CoordinatorTHE HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE PLANAT A GLANCEPEOPLE IN NEEDTOTAL POPULATIONOF IRAQREQUIREMENTS (US$)HUMANITARIANPARTNERSPEOPLE TARGETED6.7M37M94701M1.75MPARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS IN 2019PEOPLE WHO NEED HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE6.7MBAGHDAD4 M2 M1 M200,000AL-DINDIYALAMUTHANNANAJAFBASRAHWASSITMISSANKIRKUKQADISSIYATHI-QARSULAY-MANIYAHINTERNALLY DISPLACED PEOPLEIN-CAMPS0.5M1.5MRETURNEES4.0MVULNERABLE HOST COMMUNITIES0.39MSTRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 3STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 1STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 2Strengthening contingency planning and preparedness. Post-conflict transitiontowards durable solutions.Ensuring the Centrality of Protection. $BABYONKERBALAERBILDAHUKNINEWAANBARSALAHINTERNALLY DISPLACED PEOPLEOUT-OF-CAMPS5,000100,000This map shows the number and presence of organizationsappealing through the Humanitarian Response Plan 2019.Numbers per governorate are not mutually exclusive, an organization may operate in more than one governorate.250,0004M200,0001.5M150,000500,000!!94405878665537231761864472516In addition to approximately 250,000 Syrian refugeesAs the humanitarian crisis in Iraq enters its fifth year, almost 18 per cent of the population is in need of some form of humanitarian assistance. Cumulatively, 6 million people were displaced during the conflict against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) from 2014 to 2017. While more than 4 million people have returned to their communities, approximately 1.8 million people remain displaced, and 54 per cent1 of all internally displaced persons (IDPs) have been displaced for three or more years. The prolonged nature of their displacement has led to increased vulnerabilities among IDPs; in 11 districts, displaced persons are facing a very high severity of needs.2 Approximately 11 per cent of 4 million returnees are in locations where living conditions OVERVIEW OFTHE CRISISAlthough the humanitarian context in Iraq has transitioned into a new phase, vulnerable people continue to face immense challenges. Almost 18 per cent of Iraq’s population is in need of some form of humanitarian assistance as a result of the crisis which began in 2014.CRISIS TIMELINE JAN 2014Fighting begins in Anbar and Fallujah falls, displacing about 85,000 people.MAY 2014People displaced by violence in Anbar reach 550,000.JUN 2014Mosul falls and violence spreads across north-central displacements increase to 1.2 million, though some displaced quickly return to Mosul.MAY 2015Military operations in Anbar trigger displacement.

Almost 138,000 residential buildings4 were impacted by the conflict. Emergency coping strategies5 are being employed by many vulnerable groups, particularly out-of-camp IDPs. A total of 60 per cent of people in need have insufficient income to meet their basic needs6 and 34 per cent are accumulating debt to purchase essential items.7 Nearly 2.4 million people are susceptible to food insecurity; 5.5 million people require health care; 4.5 million people need protection support; 2.3 million people require water and sanitation assistance; 2.6 million children lack access to education and 2.3 million people are in need of shelter and non-food items (NFIs).8 Protection remains the overarching humanitarian priority in Iraq in 2019 and is at the core of humanitarian response. There are multiple pressing protection concerns, including retaliation against people with perceived affiliations to extremist groups; forced, premature, uninformed and obstructed returns; a lack of civil documentation; severe movement restrictions in camps; arbitrary detention, IDPs and returnees who require specialized psychosocial support; extensive explosive hazard contamination and housing, land and property issues.  Multiple Needs and Vulnerabilities While the combat operations against ISIL ended in 2017, reverberations from the conflict are likely to continue into 2019, resulting in new vulnerabilities. In areas of displacement – especially the northern governorates which host a large proportion of IDPs – rent prices are increasing, negatively affecting IDPs, host communities and returnees.9 It is estimated that 31 per cent of households have a monthly income below the poverty line (92,000 IQD/month).10 Unpredictable customs procedures instituted during the latter half of 2018 have caused a temporary spike in some food and non-food items (NFI) prices. Natural disasters (particularly floods, droughts and earthquakes) and communicable disease outbreaks (especially in the southern governorates) may continue to pose risks to populations already required to demonstrate extraordinary resilience to cope with the effects of armed conflict. Preparedness and contingency plans are being formulated in order to respond to possible scenarios. In 2018, significant decreases in the quantity and quality of the public water supply impacted 25 per cent of the total population in southern governorates11 (approximately 1.9 million people), negatively affecting a region where the poverty rate was already above 30 per cent.12 As of October 2018, more than 110,000 people in the southern city of Basrah had admitted themselves to the hospital with gastrointestinal symptoms attributed to contaminated water.13 Between January and August 2018, 217 alerts for communicable diseases—including measles, acute flaccid paralysis, and meningitis—were received, primarily in Ninewa, Sulaymaniyah and Dahuk. While almost all governorates are considered drought prone, forecasts indicate that moderate to severe droughts are expected in certain locations until 2026.14 Iraq experienced severe floods in February, May and November 2018. During the November floods alone, thousands of people were displaced and several IDP camps were partially inundated, leading to the temporary relocation of already at-risk IDPs. Other circumstances which jeopardize the well-being of IDPs can arise unpredictably. Approximately 65 per cent of 460,000 in-camp IDPs received only half food rations in October 2018 due to an unexpected pipeline break in the World Food Programme’s (WFP) distribution network. More than 20,000 households are in need of tent replacement and continue to be exposed to harsh winter and summer weather due to the conditions of their tents. Approximately 229,900 IDPs in 33 camps are receiving less than 35 litres water/per person/per day which is less than the Iraq WASH Cluster standard for water trucking. An estimated 32 per cent of hospitals and 14 per cent of Primary Health Care Centres (PHCCs) in Ninewa are destroyed, while 35 per cent of PHCCs in Kirkuk are not functional and 17 per cent of hospitals in Anbar are only partially functioning.15 On average, out-of-camp IDPs in Anbar and Ninewa face overlapping needs in more than four humanitarian sectors.16 Different Groups, Different Impacts, Different Response There are several different sub-groups among Iraq’s population of IDPs with particular vulnerabilities. An DISTRIBUTION OF IDP POPULATION BY TIME OF DISPLACEMENT0100,000200,000300,000400,000500,000Jul ’14Jan ’15Jul ’15Jan ’16Jul ’16Jan ’17Jul ’17Jan ’18Jul ’18Early 2014 to mid 2014Mid 2014 to mid 2015Mid 2015 to mid 2016Mid 2016 to mid 2017Mid 2017 to mid 2018estimated 13 per cent of all IDP and returnee households are headed by females and they are at heightened risk of gender-based violence.17 In seven districts, between 22 - 34 per cent of families are led by heads of household with disability that affects their ability to perform daily living activities.18 In 2019, an estimated 2.1 million children could be at risk of rights violation and unable to access essential services due to their vulnerabilities. They are likely to face discrimination in accessing civil documentation and essential services. These children are likely to be exposed to psychological distress, violence at home, child labour, and sexual violence including child marriage. Ninewa, Kirkuk, Salah al-Din and Anbar governorates show the highest number of conflict-affected children at risk. During the first nine months of 2018, there were 156 incidents of grave child rights violations, including 57 children killed and 70 children maimed. Persons with perceived affiliation to extremist groups are at heightened risk of violence, exploitation, discrimination and a range of human rights violations. Within camps, they are often isolated and segregated, subjected to movement restrictions, denied access to humanitarian aid, and exposed to sexual violence, exploitation and abuse. The humanitarian needs of groups with specific vulnerabilities are not expected to diminish until they are able to re-establish their livelihoods, reunite with family members, and access basic services. Social cohesion also remains a goal of the international community in Iraq. Therefore, the design of humanitarian programmes must take the specific needs and concerns of different groups into account.Durable Solutions and Basic Services The poverty rate in the areas most impacted by military operations against the ISIL exceeds 40 per cent,19 which adversely affects the capacity of IDPs and returnees to rebuild their lives. While the resilience and coping capacity of affected people have been remarkable, they are exhausted and many people still have limited access to government social protection programmes. Recent labour market statistics suggest further deterioration of welfare standards in the country.20 The unemployment rate, which was falling before the arrival of ISIL, has climbed back to 2012 levels.21 The most enduring needs in the governorates most impacted by ISIL are education and health,22 along with social protection, employment, and livelihoods,23 all of which underpin IDPs’ efforts to work towards durable solutions to their displacement. Achievements and GapsSome notable achievements in humanitarian response were made in 2018, with an improved operating environment since the end of combat operations in December 2017. The Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government, supported by national civil society organizations and religious groups, are committed to providing the bulk of humanitarian assistance to the displaced persons. In 2018, authorities provided almost 1 million blankets, 1 million health baskets, more than 1.6 million dry food baskets,24 and legal aid assistance to more than 100,000 families.25 The Government’s 2018 action plan26 focused on several areas where cooperation and support from humanitarian organizations was encouraged. This support is expected to continue in 2019, when increased focus will be placed on the urgent and underfunded tasks of restoring basic services, providing livelihood opportunities and serving people in protracted displacement. The humanitarian community will continue to work closely with the Government to ensure humanitarian activities complement national-led interventions, and to advocate for expanding the humanitarian space to enable safe access to all locations where humanitarian needs have been identified. By the end of 2018, 2.9 million people out of 3.4 million people (85 per cent) targeted by humanitarian partners were reached with some form of humanitarian assistance. Of this 2.9 million, 1.4 million were women and girls and 1.3 million were children.27 Some 170 organizations implemented programmes across 107 of Iraq’s 109 districts: 500,000 people were reached every month with food baskets;28 3.1 million people were reached with protection assistance; 2.9 million people were provided with health services and assistance;29 WASH partners reached 1.3 million people; and 1.6 million people had their NFI needs met while 231,974 people received shelter assistance.30 An estimated 540,000 displaced people in camps and collective centres received assistance from CCCM; 682,000 children and youth benefited from quality education programmes;31 and 16,000 people were offered livelihood options to increase their income.32 RRM partners provided life-saving supplies to 125,000 people, and an average of 3,200 families received one-off multi-purpose cash assistance (MPCA) while 2,200 families received multi-month MPCA.33Nevertheless, gaps remain. The majority of the humanitarian response to date has focused on serving people displaced in camps, although this population accounts for only 29 per cent of the IDP population overall.34 Response in Ninewa Governorate was more than double the planned target, due to a heavy focus on Mosul. In certain locations, humanitarian assistance reached a third or less than the targets in districts with high or very high severity of needs, such as Balad, Baiji, Daur and Shirqat (Salah al-Din); Ba’aj and Sinjar (Ninewa); Haditha and Rutba (Anbar) and Hawiga and Kirkuk city (Kirkuk). Partly this can be attributed to access restrictions in these areas.The estimated total number of people in need has decreased from 8.7 million in 2018 to 6.7 million in 2019. Out of the 6.7 million people who need some form of humanitarian assistance, 3.3 million are female (women and girls) and 3.3 million are children. People perceived to be affiliated with extremist groups are among the most vulnerable, along with women, children, people with disabilities and the elderly. People in protracted displacement and returnees in sub-standard shelters, are of particular concern, as they may feel compelled to make negative or high-risk choices to cope. Adolescents have also been identified as being disproportionately affected by the cumulative effects of the crisis.35 ••Approximately 1.8 million internally displaced people living in-camp and out-of-camp settings will require some form of assistance. More than half have been displaced for over three years. It is these long-term IDPs that now make up most of the still-displaced population. Almost 30 per cent of IDPs are in Ninewa Governorate, where some of the highest country-wide poverty rates exist, further increasing their vulnerabilities. Of the total number of IDPs, a significant majority (71 per cent) reside outside of camps, mostly within the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and Ninewa governorate. ••Approximately 4 million returnees may require some form of limited humanitarian assistance. An estimated 38 per cent of these returnees are in Ninewa governorate; followed by 32 per cent in Anbar governorate where access severity as perceived by humanitarian actors is the highest. Of the 641,255 families that have returned in 2018, the breakdown by severity of the conditions (indicating a lack of livelihoods, services, social cohesion and security) is as follows: 7,833 families (very high), 65,906 families (high), 301,476 families (medium) and 266,040 families (low). The geographical clustering of the very high severity hotspots is concentrated within five northern governorates – Ninewa, Salah al-Din, Kirkuk, Diyala and Anbar. ••Approximately 400,000 vulnerable people in communities hosting large number of displaced families may require humanitarian assistance. This is a significant decrease from previous four years, possibly attributable to the gradual reduction of the number of IDPs overall and the adjusted methodology used to more accurately estimate BREAKDOWN OF PEOPLE IN NEEDThe cumulative effects of four years of conflict, coupled with continued human rights violations, limited access to livelihoods and services, and inadequate social cohesion has left an estimated 6.7 million people across Iraq in need of some form of humanitarian assistance.AGGREGATE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN NEED6.7 MTOTAL NUMBER OF DISPLACED PEOPLE 2.0 MVULNERABLE HOST COMMUNITIES 0.39 MDISPLACED PEOPLE OUT OF CAMPS1.5 MDISPLACED PEOPLE IN CAMPS 0.5 MRETURNEES4.0 MREFUGEES0.25 Mthe extent of economically vulnerable people in host communities.

Pockets of high or very high concentration of needs are additionally found within the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (Erbil, Dahuk, and Sulaymaniyah governorates) but also in Diyala, Baghdad and the southern part of the country. The findings of the MCNA Severity Index align to a large extent with the inter-cluster overall severity index, with the concentration of needs identified in similar locations. Taking the displaced population as a whole, some 53 per cent of in-camp IDPs, 33 per cent of out-of-camp IDPs, and 32 per cent of returnees are in need of assistance from three or more sectors, out of a total of seven assessed.36 ••Out-of-camp IDPs in Anbar and Ninewa are the only group for which, on average, there are overlapping needs in more than four sectors. Negative emergency coping strategies37 were found to be higher in out-of-camp IDPs, particularly in Kirkuk and Ninewa governorates. ••In-camp IDPs where needs have been identified in more than three sectors are in Ramadi (Anbar), Tikrit (Salah al-Din), Mosul and Hamdaniya (Ninewa) and Akre (Ninewa) districts. ••Returnees with multi-sectoral needs are found in locations in Sinjar (Ninewa), Baiji, Balad and Daur (Salah al-Din) and Mahmoudiya (Baghdad).38••Returnees in certain locations in Ninewa, notably Al-Ba’aj, Sinjar and Telafar district centre, West Mosul, and areas of Al-Tal, Hatra and Muhalabiya also face very high severity of conditions measured against services, livelihoods, social cohesion and safety, and continue to be areas where returns remain consistently low.39Analysis of available data indicates that a coordinated multi-sectoral approach covering basic assistance and protection services coupled with recovery efforts has the potential to increase the resilience of families in need across multiple sectors, while reducing recourse to negative coping strategies. This would significantly help to prevent a deterioration in the humanitarian situation and further setbacks in the early recovery, reconstruction and rehabilitation processes. SEVERITY OF PEOPLE IN NEEDThe most urgent needs are found in areas where past hostilities have led to destruction of infrastructure, a breakdown of services and erosion of social fabric, or in areas indirectly impacted due to hosting and providing for a sizeable displaced population. Limited livelihood opportunities in these locations are a key compounding factor keeping some of the most vulnerable people dependent on humanitarian assistance.SEVERITY OF NEEDshikhanTilkaifHamdaniyaMosulTelafarsumelDahukAkreErbilBa'ajsinjarHatrazakhoshirqatBaijiHadithakhanaqinkifriBaladroozMuqdadiyakhalisToozkalarTarmiaHeetRutbaka'imRamadiFallujaAinAl-TamurkerbalaNajafTikritBadrakutNa'maniyaMahawilAli Al-gharbiAmaraRifa'iHaiAfaqDiwaniyaHashimiyakufaManatheraHillashamiyaHamzasalmanRumaithaMejarAl-kabiMaimounakahlaqal'atsalehMidainaqurnasamawakhidhirNassriyasuq Al-shoyokhChibayishzubairshattAl-ArabBasrahAbuAl-khaseebFaoMada'inshatraHawijaDaquqMusayabMakhmurChamchamalMergasurAmedisoranChomanPshdarRaniashaqlawakoisnjaqDokansulaymaniyasharbazherHalabjaPenjwinDarbandihkanAbughraibkadhimiaThawra1karkhFaresAnaRu'uaDaurBaladThetharkirkukDabesAzeziasuwairasamarraBa’quba- +Severity of needSource: Severity of needs is established based on a composite index of 12 indicators structured across four domains definitive of the current humanitarian crisis. This is further explained in the methodology section. Data comes from MCNA, IOM DTM, ILA, and cluster-specific sources. Analysis above was complemented with MCNA VI Severity Index and IOM/DTM Returns Index. Note: This map, used in conjunction with MCNA Severity Index and IOM DTM analysis on returns, serves as an overarching strategic guidance on where there are severe and overlapping needs in Iraq. It does not replace the sector severity maps which remain the main tool for programmatic and operational decisions. The 2019 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) is complementary to the humanitarian response provided by the Government of Iraq and Kurdistan Regional Government. Other international organizations, civil society, countless community groups and bilateral arrangements are also contributing to meet the needs of affected people. Of the 6.7 million people who will need some form of assistance in 2019, humanitarian partners will provide support to the most vulnerable people in line with humanitarian principles under the overarching strategic objectives as below:Strategic Objective OneIn the post-conflict transition towards durable solutions, partners will aim to increase the resilience of affected people by supporting access to basic services, enhancing livelihood opportunities and providing sectoral assistance to meet minimum humanitarian standards. Areas with a high severity of needs will be prioritized for intervention. Organizations will target displaced people both in camps and in out-of-camp locations, returnees who have not yet achieved sustainable solutions, and communities hosting displaced people. These interventions will be implemented according to the needs identified through coordinated assessments.Humanitarian partners have committed to prioritising the Grand Bargain localisation work stream and will collaborate with national and local organizations in programming wherever possible. The humanitarian community in Iraq will also coordinate with relevant development and recovery/resilience frameworks to ensure responsible transition and complementarity in accordance with the basic principles of the New Way of Working.Strategic Objective TwoResponding to the key protection needs of affected people is a priority for the humanitarian community and will be enhanced through strategic leadership, coordination, advocacy, programming, capacity-building and monitoring across all sectors and clusters. As the humanitarian context in Iraq enters a new phase, the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) is developing a post-conflict protection strategy, which reflects the current operational landscape. The Inter-Cluster Coordination Group (ICCG) will put practical actions in place to address key protection challenges in line with the HCT’s strategy. High-level advocacy will be undertaken for people with perceived affiliation to extremist groups to ensure humanitarian principles are respected in responding to their humanitarian needs, and rights violations are addressed by relevant authorities. Such advocacy will STRATEGICOBJECTIVESIn support of the Government’s national strategies, the humanitarian community will work towards achieving three key objectives in 2019. Partners will promote the safety, dignity and equitable access of people in need to principled humanitarian assistance.1Post-conflict transition towards durable solutions2 Ensuring the Centrality of Protection3 Strengthening contingency planning and preparednessbe informed by data collection by all clusters on denial of assistance and other protection concerns affecting this particular sub-group. Individuals and families with perceived affiliations will benefit from needs-based sectoral and protection interventions in both camps and non-camp settings. To address the intermittent presence of armed security actors in certain IDP camps which compromises camps’ civilian and humanitarian character and has resulted in documented cases of arbitrary arrest and detention, harassment and physical violence, gender-based violence (GBV) and child protection incidents the Prime Minister’s April 2017 directive on the civilian nature of camps will be promoted. Camp consolidation and closure processes will be managed by Governorate Return Committees implementing the Principled Returns Framework, and adherence to agreed-upon processes and standards will be reinforced at both the central and governorate levels, through strengthened engagement with civilian authorities, military and security actors. The harmonisation of multiple GBV initiatives will be prioritized, including through strengthening GBV services for child survivors through collaboration between the GBV and Child Protection Sub-Clusters, ensuring complementarities between the GBV mainstreaming efforts of different UN agencies, strengthened information-sharing between the established inter-cluster network of GBV focal points, and the usage of GBV Information Management System (IMS)40 data for evidence-based advocacy. In addition, the Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA)41 Network will be reinforced through proactive programming, investigation of allegations and accountability, victim assistance and support, and awareness-raising. In line with IASC Guidelines on “Accountability to Affected Populations”,42 clusters will seek to enhance existing mechanisms through which affected people can provide feedback and channel complaints, as well as improve the resolution rates of referrals, complaints and feedback received from the Iraq IDP Information Centre (IIC). Relevant information will be regularly channelled back to the affected population. Strategic Objective ThreeHumanitarian partners are committed to improving the timeliness of response to new emergencies through collective preparedness and contingency planning to identified risks. Among other preparedness concerns, Iraq faces a set of environmental challenges and natural hazards. In the 2019 INFORM Global Risk, the country was evaluated as being a 9.5 (out of 10) for the risk of floods and 7.0 (out of 10) for the risk of earthquakes.43 Moreover, Iraq’s vulnerability index (measuring the economic, political and social characteristics of the community that can be destabilized in case of a hazard event) is almost double compared with the average score of countries in the same income group.44 Drought risk with increased land degradation, increasingly limited supplies of clean water, climate variability,45 Iraq’s position in a seismically active zone, and previous trends of disease outbreaks makes preparation for and mitigation of hazards a priority for the humanitarian community. Humanitarian partners will prioritize government-led prevention, preparedness and immediate response, while longer-term impacts will be supported through development frameworks, such as UNDAF. Multiple, unpredictable, volatile dynamics whether conflict-related or natural hazards are likely to continue impacting civilians and could result in new displacement events. While the national social protection programme of the Government is being enhanced to eventually support all low-income persons in need, newly displaced people are likely to require humanitarian assistance. All relevant sectors will contribute to contingency planning to ensure first line support to the newly displaced. Planning Assumptions The number of IDPs in Iraq is expected to continue its steady decline. However, in the absence of durable solutions, considering that over half of all IDPs have been in displacement for more than three years, that approximately 63 per cent of displaced people intend to remain in their current locations in the next 12 months,46 this reduction in overall IDP numbers is not expected to be rapid, particularly in camps. Unpredictable elements exist: asymmetric attacks by ISIL-remnants cannot be ruled out; new conflict-induced displacement could occur. While areas considered “inaccessible” due to high levels of insecurity or blanket denials of passage are expected to be relatively few, clearly identifiable and largely localized, such factors nonetheless put a strain on humanitarian partners’ capacity to serve those most in need.The slow progress of Government-led reconciliation processes may impact prospects for the transition to durable solutions, especially for the most vulnerable returnees. Lack of sufficient basic services, livelihood opportunities, and extensive contamination with explosive hazards will continue to hamper returns, which could result in protracted displacement (particularly for those in camps), and re-displacement for those who have prematurely returned. As a result, return rates may remain low in 2019. The Government’s social protection programmes will likely continue to only partially function. Poverty and unemployment rates, especially in southern Iraq and some localized areas such as western Ninewa, may also contribute to increased vulnerability for certain groups.Protection concerns will continue as families and communities grapple with post-conflict realities. Issues of particular concern include: social marginalization and rights violations of people with perceived affiliation to extremist groups; gender-based violence, including sexual exploitation and abuse; conflict-affected children; lack of respect for principled returns; and armed security actors’ presence in camps. Transition from humanitarian assistance provided by the international community to Government-provided assistance will take time, especially in some sectors where the strategy, capacity, human resources and resource allocations of the authorities are unclear, inadequate or still in the early stages of planning.Prioritization Approach The 2019 Humanitarian Response Plan acknowledges that the humanitarian needs of 6.7 million people will exceed the response capacity of partners. Therefore, and as per the collective Grand Bargain commitment to “prioritize humanitarian response across sectors based on evidence established by the analysis,” the humanitarian community in Iraq will concentrate on providing multi-sectoral response to the most vulnerable IDPs, returnees and host communities, based on the needs identified in the 2019 Humanitarian Needs Overview. The HRP is designed to support the efforts of the Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government and takes into consideration possible synergies with other international frameworks being implemented in the country. This prioritization was also informed by feasibility (access, capacity, resources) and appropriateness of response (do no harm, impartiality, relevance). Partners will work towards improving the quality of assistance and ensuring equitable delivery. Priorities will be reviewed at regular intervals based on the monitoring of outcomes. Response Parameters and ScopeResponse TargetsHumanitarian partners will target 1.75 million people in the post-conflict transitional phase. Approximately 0.5 million out of 4 million returnees are in locations with high or very high severity of conditions47 that are clustered in Anbar, Baghdad, Diyala, Erbil, Kirkuk, Ninewa and Salah al-Din governorates. These people suffer from restrained access to livelihoods and basic services as well as challenges in social cohesion and safety. Therefore, they will be prioritized for inter-sectoral response with RESPONSESTRATEGYHumanitarian partners aim to reach 1.75 million people with some form of humanitarian assistance in 2019. Priorities will include vulnerable IDPs who have not been able to achieve durable solutions, people who find themselves in protracted displacement, and people with severe protection needs.a focus on shelter rehabilitation, provision of protection assistance, livelihoods/cash for work and strengthening of their ability to meet basic needs. Almost 500,000 displaced people in 125 IDP camps will remain a primary target for humanitarian assistance. In many of these camps, overall minimum service standards have not significantly improved from the initial emergency phase due to lack of investment and upgrades.48 The large caseload, protracted nature of displacement, and age of the camps (some camps are over four years old, particularly in Dahuk), are also contributing factors. However, partners will not be able to improve the minimum standards of service in all 125 camps due to a number of reasons, besides only a third of camps host more than 5,000 people. Camps with poor infrastructure in remote locations which host a limited number of families are not efficient or effective at serving the needs of IDPs. While the humanitarian community will not propose camp closures unless residents can depart voluntarily back to areas of origin where conditions are conducive for their durable return, they will advocate for the consolidation of camps and the transfer of IDPs to larger camps with better service provision (including medical and educational support) and improved security arrangements. Partners will target approximately 0.55 million out of 1.5 million displaced people in out-of-camp locations, focusing on 20 locations with high or very high density of IDPs. Around three quarters of 116,000 IDPs49 in collective centres and informal settlements are in critical need of humanitarian assistance,50 with 97 per cent reporting no intention to return in the next 12 months or unsure of their future plans.51 Partners will also prioritize 0.2 million people in host communities where there is a high or very high geographic density of displaced people, who can place an additional burden on basic services and access to livelihoods. Geographical ScopeHumanitarian response will strategically prioritize 30 districts in 10 governorates (Anbar, Baghdad, Dahuk, Diyala, Erbil, Kirkuk, Najaf, Ninewa, Salah al-Din and Sulaymaniyah) out of the 18 governorates in Iraq, based the severity of needs as identified at the 2019 Humanitarian Needs Overview. This will ensure the strengthening and diversifying of operational capacity and response outside specific areas where operational capacity was heavily concentrated in 2018, such as Mosul city.For IDPs in out-of-camp locations and host communities, humanitarian partners will target 20 of these 30 prioritized districts, where there is high level of concentration of IDPs. For returnees, the focus will be on five governorates (Anbar, Diyala, Kirkuk, Ninewa and Salah al-Din). For IDPs in camps, the entire IDP population in all the locations across the country will be targeted to maintain or attain minimum standards of service delivery. More significant upgrades will be considered only for those camps with sizeable populations, where people have not indicated any intention to move out soon (i.e. within the next year at least), and for which minimum standards of care can be maintained. For contingency planning, partners will target the entire country, with specific geographical focus for different risks. For water and drought related hazards and disease outbreaks, southern governorates will be prioritized based on historical data and trend analysis. For floods, both southern and northern governorates will be targeted with a focus on IDP camps at risk of floods, based on patterns observed in 2018. For earthquakes, country-wide coverage will be considered.These parameters will be reviewed on a regular basis to maintain a humanitarian response that can adapt to evolving needs and dynamic conditions. Centrality of ProtectionAll humanitarian interventions under the HRP will be anchored by the centrality of protection, taking account of the differential impacts of the crisis on various population groups, due to their unique vulnerabilities and coping capacities. Clusters and sectors have incorporated protection risk analysis and mitigation measures in their response plans, and protection considerations will be mainstreamed throughout the implementation of their response. While 2 million people will be targeted through direct assistance of humanitarian protection partners, all clusters/sectors will target those considered to be highly vulnerable due to their specific circumstances. In particular, individuals with perceived affiliation to extremist groups, survivors of GBV including sexual exploitation and abuse, children at risk, persons with disabilities or chronic conditions, older persons, and individuals subject to forced and premature returns will be prioritized for humanitarian interventions. Their needs will be addressed through a strategic approach that relies on effective leadership at the HC/HCT level, a combination of local and high-level advocacy interventions with civilian authorities and military/security actors, inter-cluster coordination, and integrated programming to foster a favourable protection environment. In line with the Grand Bargain commitments, the HCT will prioritize strengthening mechanisms to provide accountability to affected populations by ensuring that functional complaint and feedback mechanisms are incorporated into all HRP projects, increasing problem resolution rates and multi-sectoral response to needs identified through the Rapid Protection Assessments (RPA), HC/HCT-led high level interventions to address protection incidents highlighted in the Critical Protection LIST OF PRIORITIZED DISTRICTS WITH RETURNEES, IDPS AND HOSTSGovernorateDistrictHNO 2019 Overall SeverityPrioritized RETURN areas (based on DTM RI Round 1 hostpots Extreme + High)Prioritized IDP/HOST areas (based on concentra..on of IDPs out-of-camp)Salah al-DinTikritVery highNinewaTelafarHighAnbarFallujaHighNinewaHamdaniyaHighNinewaTilkaifHighNinewaMosulHighDahukSumelHighNinewaShikhanHighAnbarHeetHighNinewaSinjarHighSalah al-DinBaladHighAnbarRamadiHighSalah al-DinDaurHighAnbarRutbaHighAnbarRu'uaHighKirkukHawigaHighSalah al-DinShirqatHighBaghdadAbu GhraibHighNinewaAkreHighErbilMakhmurHighSalah al-DinToozHighDiyalaKhanaqinHighKirkukKirkukHighDiyalaMuqdadiyaHighNajafNajafHighSalah al-DinBaijiHighAnbarHadithaModerateDahukZakhoModerateSalah al-DinSamarraModerateSulaymaniyahSulaymaniyaModerateKirkukDaquqModerateDahukDahukModerateDiyalaKhalisModerateErbilErbilModerateKerbalaHindiyaModerateAnbarKa'imModerateBaghdadMada'inModerateSulaymaniyahDokanModerateErbilShaqlawaModerateKirkukDabesModerateSulaymaniyahHalabjaModerateSulaymaniyahDarbandihkanModerateWassitNa'maniyaModerateSulaymaniyahChamchamalModerateDahukAmediModerateErbilKoisnjaqModerateNajafManatheraModerateKerbalaKerbalaModerateNinewaHatraModerateSulaymaniyahRaniaModerateDiyalaKifriModerateSulaymaniyahKalarModerateBabylonMusayabModerateBaghdadMahmoudiyaModerateNajafKufaModerateNinewaBa'ajModerateWassitKutModerateBaghdadResafaModerateBabylonHillaModerateErbilSoranModerateAnbarAnaModerateBaghdadKarkhModerateQadissiyaAfaqModerateBaghdadTarmiaModerateWassitSuwairaModerateDiyalaBa'qubaModerateIDP/HOST COMMUNITY PRIORITY AREAS FOR RESPONSERutbaSalmanNajafHatraBaijiKa'imBa'ajKutHeetZubairAnaRu'uaAmaraRamadiSinjarKifriDaurBaladroozMosulBadraTikritTelafarRifa'iHaiAfaqErbilFallujaHadithaAkreToozKhanaqinSoranDaquqKirkukNassriyaAmediKalarMakhmurHawigaAzeziaFaoHamzaKerbalaQurnaKhidhirAli Al-GharbiShatraMaimounaBaladMahawilDokanChamchamalDiwaniyaThetharZakhoSamarraKoisnjaqSumelFaresTilkaifChibayishRumaithaKhalisShirqatPshdarShaqlawaMada'inShikhanDahukBasrahHashimiyaKufaSuwairaHalabjaSharbazherSulaymaniyaDabesKahlaMergasurMidainaHamdaniyaRaniaNa'maniyaPenjwinMuqdadiyaAin Al-TamurMahmoudiyaHindiyaSuq Al-ShoyokhHillaShatt Al-ArabChomanSamawaQal'at SalehMusayabAbu Al-KhaseebMejar Al-KabiShamiyaBa'qubaTarmiaKarkhManatheraAbu GhraibKadhimiaDarbandihkanResafaAdhamiaThawra1Vulnerable hostsTop 20 district for Out-of-Camp IDPsGovernerateDistrictIDPs out-of-campsHostcommunity NinewaMosul 247,372 28,737 ErbilErbil 186,810 62,113 Dahuksumel 104,511 6,651 kirkukkirkuk 91,827 261 sulaymaniyahsulaymaniyah 79,972 11,865 Dahukzakho 62,698 24,338 salah al-DinTikrit 61,835 21,750 Baghdadkarkh 41,478 41 DahukDahuk 37,919 17,909 salah al-Dinsamarra 37,392 232 NinewaAkre 36,426 737 salah al-DinTooz 35,868 18,571 Ninewashikhan 27,048 5,336 sulaymaniyahkalar 24,477 509 DiyalaBa'quba 24,064 - Ninewasinjar 23,562 28,425 NinewaTilkaif 22,404 8,938 NajafNajaf 20,886 4,906 NinewaTelafar 17,862 21,873 kirkukDaquq 16,882 5,293 RETURNEES PRIORITY AREAS FOR RESPONSEissue notes, and increased communication with communities. Clusters and sectors have also analysed their projects’ accountability to affected people, including activities to better involve the beneficiaries in the design, response, and monitoring and evaluation activities. Additionally, through adoption of the new Gender and Age Marker, humanitarian partners working under the HRP have committed to gender- and age-responsive programming, including sex and age disaggregated data, to ensure inclusive participation and equitable access to humanitarian assistance. People with Perceived Affiliations: The shared objective of the government and the humanitarian community with regard to displaced populations is to facilitate access to durable solutions that allow them to resume a normal life in safety and dignity. However, some IDPs have been subject to allegations that they are affiliated to extremist groups, assertions which are particularly controversial in Iraq in a post-ISIL era. As a result of such allegations, some affected people have been subject to discriminatory denial of humanitarian assistance or government services, including access to civil documentation; denial of security clearances and restrictions on their movements; deprivation of liberty in camps, or segregation within camp sectors; widespread social discrimination; and obstructed returns to their areas of origin.52 Meeting the needs of the IDP population without discrimination including people with perceived affiliation to extremist groups is among the most pressing protection concerns in Iraq. The humanitarian community has developed recommendations for interim and longer-term solutions for the government to address the needs of this particular sub-group and has also advocated consistently against denial of humanitarian assistance, collective punishment, acts of violence, arbitrary detention and arrests, harassment and threats against legal aid actors, freedom of movement restrictions, segregation within camps and discriminatory rules in access to courts and civil documentation. A high-level group under the Humanitarian Coordinator’s direct leadership has been working on developing operational solutions in specific locations for these individuals. Governorate Returns Committees (GRCs): which focus on camp consolidation and closure processes were established in Baghdad, Anbar, Salah al-Din, Kirkuk, Diyala and Ninewa in 2018. Terms of Reference for the GRCs were endorsed by the Government in January 2018. Humanitarian partners continue working with the authorities through GRCs to collectively plan for camp consolidation and closure, and to advocate for principled returns and relocations to alternative camps, although progress has varied from governorate to governorate. Where returns or relocations are identified as not meeting the minimum standards for being principled, immediate advocacy interventions are undertaken at the local and/or national level. The humanitarian community has also developed a Principled Returns Framework, which was endorsed by the Government in September 2018, and which outlines the minimum standards for a return to be considered principled. The presence of armed security actors in camps compromises their civilian and humanitarian character. Protection and CCCM actors have been tracking incidents related to armed security actor presence in camps, particularly in Ninewa. This has resulted in documented cases of arbitrary arrest and detention, harassment and physical violence, gender-based violence (GBV) and child protection incidents. This incident-tracking exercise will be progressively expanded to camps in other parts of Iraq, to enable evidence-based advocacy by the HC/HCT with the Government (including civilian authorities, military and security actors), at both the national and governorate levels. At the same time, the humanitarian leadership will continue to advocate for the implementation of the Prime Minister’s April 2017 directive on the civilian nature of camps. Gender-based Violence (GBV): Gender-based violence is reported in both in-camp and out-of-camp settings. Reported incidents have included domestic violence, sexual violence, exploitation and abuse (including by security actors), forced marriage including child marriages, and denial of resources.53 GBV incidents and risks have particularly impacted women and girls with perceived affiliation to extremist groups, and female-headed households. Therefore, in 2019, strengthening of comprehensive GBV service provision will be prioritized through static centres in camps, host communities and areas of origin, and through mobile teams targeting vulnerable IDPs in out-of-camp locations, returnees and host communities. A 24-hours hotline for GBV survivors in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq has been established.  To improve the quality of and access to services for child and adolescent survivors of GBV in emergencies, an action plan is being developed under the leadership of GBV and Child Protection sub-clusters. A Real-Time Accountability Partnership (RTAP) was developed in 2018. The RTAP is a multi-agency initiative for addressing GBV, aimed at institutionalizing collaborative actions to address and prioritize GBV across the humanitarian response. A GBV mainstreaming specialist was hired by UNFPA in late 2018 to roll-out capacity-building trainings on the IASC’s GBV in Emergencies Guidelines, and GBV SOPs; in parallel, GBV mainstreaming trainings were undertaken by UNHCR with the Clusters under its responsibility. Creation of an inter-cluster network of GBV focal points was initiated to facilitate GBV mainstreaming. Recruitment of a GBV IMS specialist by the GBV sub-cluster is ongoing. Ensuring complementarity between GBV-focused initiatives, better information-sharing among agencies and partners, and improving inter-agency coordination with respect to existing expert capacities were identified in 2018 as possible areas for improvement. Thus, in 2019, the humanitarian community will work to ensure more complementarities between multiple gender-based violence mechanisms in country. Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA): The humanitarian community has established a dedicated hotline, the Iraq IDP Information Centre (IIC) to relay specific queries from beneficiaries to responding agencies and clusters, including concerns about PSEA. A PSEA network was established to coordinate and support the implementation of UN’s strategy to combat sexual exploitation and abuse. Under the Humanitarian Coordinator’s direct leadership, the network will be revitalised in 2019 to include NGOs and improve its referral pathways to address reported issues. Appropriate mechanisms will be put in place with respect to investigation of SEA incidents, including accountability measures. In 2019, the PSEA Network will be co-chaired by UNFPA and UNHCR.The OCHA-managed Iraq Humanitarian Fund (IHF) has integrated key PSEA messages and standard indicators through collaborative training which targeted all cluster leads and co-leads, as well as 102 staff from 59 IHF partner organisations. All OCHA-managed country-based pooled funds’ grant agreements include PSEA-specific clauses. Accountability to Affected People (AAP): The humanitarian community continues to place Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) at the centre of its operations. Several platforms and tools are widely used by the clusters/sectors, including the IIC. Clusters have committed to improve resolution rates to referrals, complaints and feedback received from the IIC. Moreover, affected people were consulted during the needs identification and planning processes. The HCT’s commitment and plans for ensuring improved accountability is explained further under the “Accountability to Affected Populations” chapter. Contingency Planning and PreparednessHumanitarian partners will prioritize response preparedness for three categories of risks: natural disasters (particularly floods, droughts and earthquakes); disease outbreaks (especially in the southern governorates); and new conflict-induced displacement. Coordinated cross-sectoral preparedness, monitoring and early warning will ensure sufficient response capacity based on the trend analysis of natural disasters and disease outbreaks. All relevant sectors will have contingencies to provide first line support to possible new displacements. Iraq’s available water resources have declined significantly since 2000, leading to challenges with livelihoods, crop production, unemployment, disease,54 and poverty and socio-economic development.55 Many models predict that the trend of decrease in water resources may continue, and as almost all governorates are considered drought prone with Thi-Qar being particularly vulnerable moderate to severe droughts are forecast in certain locations in the coming decade.56 Disease Outbreaks: Cholera is endemic in Iraq, with periodic outbreaks typically following seasonal increases in water contamination beginning in July, and an increase in acute diarrhoea reaching its peak in September.57 Vulnerable populations include those in camps, informal settlements and within host communities (due to overcrowded living conditions), as well as those who are living in newly accessible areas and returnees to East Mosul (due to infrastructure damages that limit access to safe water, sanitation and healthcare). The estimated number of people at risk of water scarcity is 2 million people in southern Iraq, 1 million people in conflict-affected areas, 0.5 million IDPs in camps, and 2 million people in areas endemic with cholera which showed an high incidence of cases in 2017 (Kirkuk, Sulaymaniyah, Babylon, and the areas surrounding Baghdad).58 Partners are planning a potential response for 110,000 people, taking into consideration 2 per cent attack rates, as agreed with the government in the Cholera Preparedness and Response Plan of 2018. Natural Disasters: Major floods were recorded in 2006, 2009, 2011, 2015, and 2018, affecting both settlements and agriculture. In 2015, floods displaced an estimated 84,000 people and dozens of people died from electrocution in floodwaters.59 Iraq also has a medium to high exposure to seismic hazards,60 and northern and eastern parts of the country are located on an earthquake fault line.61 For these natural disasters, the humanitarian community will monitor and mitigate risks through early warning systems (where available),62 awareness-raising and the prepositioning of contingency stocks, in parallel to the deployment of rapid response teams and emergency interventions when necessary. Partners will also focus on strengthening the emergency planning and response structures of local authorities, enhancing rapid response capacity of local actors, and developing preparedness plans and service mapping. Should it become necessary to receive new IDPs in existing camps, first line stocks will be made available in priority locations, including NFI kits and tents to cover a planned figure of 10,000 people, and immediate response rations (enough for three days for a family size of five people) for 20,000. Outside of the HRP response, another 20,000 NFI kits and 20,000 tents will be pre-positioned. Mobile clinics for populations outside of camps and static health facilities in camps are prepared to provide primary health care services for people affected by natural disasters. Emergency water, sanitation and hygiene services will be prepared for 260,000 people. Durable SolutionsAccording to the IASC Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons (2010), a durable solution for IDPs is achieved “when internally displaced persons no longer have any specific assistance and protection needs that are linked to their displacement and can enjoy their human rights without discrimination on account of their displacement.”63 Such a solution can be achieved through: the voluntary return of IDPs to their areas of origin; local integration in areas of displacement; or relocation in another part of the country.These IASC benchmarks have already been articulated in the Principled Returns Framework developed by the humanitarian community and endorsed by the Government in 2018. Humanitarian partners will continue to support principled and sustainable returns through provision of assistance in areas of origin, such as:••shelter rehabilitation support and NFI distribution; ••explosive hazard survey and clearance; ••legal assistance on civil documentation (including PDS food ration cards), arbitrary arrest/detention and housing, land and property (HLP) issues; ••specialized services for unaccompanied or separated children; ••livelihoods support, including to address food insecurity; ••supporting access to the Government’s social protection system; and ••WASH, health and education interventions. Humanitarian partners will engage in communication with communities, including explosive hazard risk education, and dissemination of ‘Know Before You Go’ messaging that encourages IDPs to use their personal networks to gather information about safety and security, and access to basic services in their areas of origin, in order to make informed decisions about whether and when to return. Community Resource Centres (CRC) have been established in areas with high density of returnees and will be expanded in 2019. CRCs serve as information and referral hubs, to enable access to humanitarian and recovery assistance, as well as government services. Similarly, community centres operated by protection partners in areas of origin will deliver specialized protection interventions, including case management and legal assistance. Moreover, Rapid Protection Assessments are already contributing to identification of social tensions in areas of origin, which protection partners will seek to systematically refer to recovery actors undertaking medium-term social cohesion interventions in such areas, and to Government-led longer-term reconciliation efforts. Collectively, these interventions by humanitarian actors are intended to contribute to the sustainability of returns, and thereby to the achievement of durable solutions to displacement. Many displaced people aspire to local integration within host communities due to challenges in their areas of origin, including limited economic opportunities, inadequate access to services, HLP damage/destruction, explosive hazard contamination, ongoing insecurity and tribal/sectarian disputes.64 Returning families have often suffered considerable hardship due to non-restoration of basic services like water, electricity education and health. Lack of these services has resulted in secondary displacement for some people, including resorting into re-entering IDP camps. The humanitarian leadership will ensure sufficient capacity is available for the articulation and implementation of a comprehensive Durable Solutions Framework for the Iraq context, which will encompass humanitarian, recovery and development interventions, and align these with the Government of Iraq’s National Development Plan 2018-2022. There are legitimate concerns about whether conditions are ripe in some parts of Iraq for the initiation of discussions on local integration and relocation options. As such, for the time being, humanitarian partners continue to advocate for lifting of movement restrictions faced by displaced people, so they can access livelihood opportunities, education, healthcare, courts and civil registries, and thereby attain a semblance of self-reliance. In some locations, progress towards clear and coherent implementation of the full spectrum of durable solutions is more advanced than others, thanks to continued dialogue with the local authorities. Preference for local integration is reportedly stronger for those IDPs currently residing in southern governorates due to safety and family connections.For those displaced Iraqis who are unable or unwilling to return to their areas of origin in the long-term, the humanitarian community will continue to provide assistance where humanitarian needs remain, while the Government and international partners will facilitate access to solutions other than return, namely: local integration or relocation to another part of the country. AssessmentsIn 2019, the humanitarian community plans to conduct at least 28 sector-specific assessments (a large majority partner-led localized-assessments) and seven large-scale multi-sectoral or cross-sectoral assessments across Iraq to fill as much as possible the geographical, thematic and targeted population gaps identified in the second half of 2018. The planning of these assessments depends on partner presence, assessment capacity and funding, all of which seem to be on a downward trend in 2019. The assessment cycle stands as a guidance for partners to align data collection plans (refer to the annex). When possible, methodologies should be harmonized to ensure comparability of data. The planned partner assessments are illustrated in the 3W for assessments in the annex. Response Modalities In recognition of the varying operational contexts for different population groups and the preferences of affected people, the humanitarian community will consider the use of different implementation modalities based on what is appropriate and feasible. For displaced people in camps, sectoral assistance through in-kind and/or cash-based programmes will be decided based on the profile of the camp population and access to markets. For communities hosting large numbers of displaced people, partners will support government infrastructures and efforts made towards restoring access to basic services, including the provision of cash assistance to meet basic needs (via multi-purpose cash assistance). For returnees, response modalities may be a mixture depending on most feasible options, which contribute to durable solutions. Throughout, livelihoods and access to basic services will be prioritized. The humanitarian community will continue to strengthen its inter-sectoral service mapping to ensure more tailored response modality for different groups of people and allow a stronger inter-sectoral referral mechanism. The humanitarian community will continue progress towards its Grand Bargain commitment to work towards transitioning to cash-based response modalities where feasible and appropriate. In Iraq, markets are largely functioning and accessible with the exception of some localized areas. Data from MPCA programming reveals that cash assistance is to a large extent the preferred modality of vulnerable people, and the social protection assistance facilitated by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (MoLSA) to more than 1 million Iraqis is distributed through cash transfers. The money transfer agent network (hawala) has proven its capacity to scale up and overcome obstacles. Mobile service providers have facilitated cash assistance for many years through the distribution of SIM cards across Iraq for Cash Working Group (CWG) partners and are working together with these agencies on ways to improve the accountability and quality of implementation. Out of the project budgets presented for the 2019 HRP, 61 per cent will go to projects that have a cash component, and 26 per cent of the budget is dedicated to cash-based initiatives channelled through MPCA, targeting 740,000 individuals, including an estimated 23 per cent of female-headed households.In order to meet basic needs, in 2018, the CWG’s Market Monitoring Task Force reviewed the Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket (SMEB) and set the transfer value for MPCA for basic needs at 480,000 IQD/month.65 Approximately 66 per cent66 of displaced people in out-of-camp locations, returnees and those who lived in the areas directly affected by the conflict but were not displaced during the conflict have an estimated monthly income below the SMEB. Since 2016, the CWG’s Joint Price Monitoring Initiative has been providing the humanitarian community with regular price monitoring for the items included in the SMEB. A draft action plan is under discussion with the MoLSA to link humanitarian MPCA with the Social Safety Protection Cash Transfer Programme. A preliminary analysis of the MoLSA and CWG tools revealed an approximate 70 per cent complementarity between the indicators used to identify eligible beneficiaries. Thanks to a CWG-led revision of the current socio-economic vulnerability scoring model for MPCA, in 2019 it will be possible to produce geographical estimations of the number of MPCA assessed people who are likely to be eligible for MoLSA social safety programme and generate evidence-based advocacy to support their inclusion in government social safety nets. In parallel, the World Bank and humanitarian actors are establishing a national social protection forum which is expected to form a bridge between humanitarian, early recovery, development and non-contributory government social safety net programmes. Seasonal considerations are also accounted for through winter response. Inter-sectoral response options through Shelter NFI, WASH, CCCM and Health clusters will analyse the needs across the country and propose prioritized response plans based on inter-sectoral eligibility criteria, taking into consideration the needs of those most vulnerable also in relation to their substandard living conditions.Strategic Use of Iraq Pooled FundThrough the Standard and Reserve Allocation modalities, the IHF allocates funds to strategically support prioritized activities as identified in inter-cluster response plans (e.g. the HRP or cluster contingency plans such as a winterization plan), while retaining flexibility to quickly release funds to address emerging unmet needs and critical funding gaps. Through 2019, greater emphasis will be placed on supporting national NGOs through direct and indirect funding and capacity-building, in line with commitments made at the World Humanitarian Summit. With the introduction of the CBPF Performance Index (PI), partner risk levels evaluated during the initial capacity assessment and due diligence process are adjusted according to partner performance on IHF funded project implementation, monitoring, reporting and audits. Furthermore, IHF funds are allocated strategically by prioritising low-risk and medium-risk partners, while applying a more robust risk management scheme to high-risk partners as per the Fund’s operational modalities. Localisation, Responsible Transition and PartnershipsIraq’s system-wide Level 3 emergency response designation was deactivated in 2018. To facilitate a smooth transition, the HCT implemented an action plan with key milestones and benchmarks to ensure continuing operational stability. In 2019, the HCT will prioritize responsible transition for prolonged humanitarian needs through durable solutions. This will be implemented by sectoral transitional plans and close cooperation with recovery and development actors. Clusters are fully engaged with their government counterparts at multiple levels for a responsible transition. However, there is insufficient evidence that transition planning is matched with allocation of government budgets to assume service provision in 2019. This poses challenges for some sectors in fully implementing a transition strategy. The operating environment in Iraq warrants a forward-looking approach in linking humanitarian activities to development action. Therefore, discussions between humanitarian and development focal points on contextual analysis are ongoing. Additional endeavours are necessary to establishing linkages with the resilience/recovery and development frameworks in-country, and more efforts should be made to strengthen operational coordination and to avoid duplication of efforts and gaps. The HCT has been putting significant efforts into enhancing engagement with national NGOs, as a step towards its Grand Bargain commitments. In the post-conflict transitional era, the ICCG decided to prioritize localisation as one out of three main work streams under the Grand Bargain (the other two being increasing cash-based interventions and focus on the humanitarian development nexus). More than half of the partners reporting activities under a coordinated humanitarian response in 2018 are national NGOs.67 Since its establishment in 2015, the IHF has allocated over US$ 22 million (10 per cent of its funding) to national NGOs. The IHF is committed to increasing this figure, ensuring that any increase in funding to national partners is balanced against a robust risk management framework to verify that partners have the required capacity to handle any increase in funding. Accordingly, the IHF has provided suitable training to national NGOs, regularly monitors their projects, and provides feedback to enhance their programme quality and institutional capacity to implement and manage grants. The Fund’s risk management activities in 2018 identified several national NGO partners with poor institutional capacity and sought to work with these partners to strengthen internal systems and processes. Clusters also provide extensive training support to national NGOs in their respective area of work. NO LOST GENERATIONThe No Lost Generation initiative advocates on behalf of children and young people affected by the crises in Syria and Iraq to ensure they have access to education and opportunities to engage positively in their communities. A strong commitment on the part of the government, combined with efforts from humanitarian and development actors, will help rebuild the education system and ensure every child enjoys their right to a quality education. At the same time, adolescent girls and boys remain a highly vulnerable group for major child protection risks including child labour, child marriage, and gender-based violence. Partners will focus on case management and resilience programs for out-of-school adolescents, while promoting integration of child protection in schools and other learning spaces. GENDER AND AGE MARKERIn 2018, the Gender and Age Marker (GAM) replaced the previous Gender Marker and became the new standard for UN and partner projects to increase gender and age responsive programming during the Humanitarian Programme Cycle. The GAM provides guidance on project design that will result in more equitable benefits and satisfaction, as well as accountability, protection, and communication with communities.The majority of HRP projects, 69 per cent, were completed the Gender with Age Marker (GAM) for project design, and of those projects completed with GAM, 95 per cent addressed gender or gender and age differences throughout their programme design. Fifty-three per cent of projects have a clear analysis of the effects of gender and/or age inequality in Iraq, often including gender-based violence. In terms of involvement of affected people, 98 per cent of projects involve affected people in different aspects of project management with 86 per cent of projects involving beneficiaries in assessment, 80 per cent in design, 75 per cent delivery of assistance and 63 per cent. AccessAreas considered ‘inaccessible’ due to ongoing conflict, high levels of insecurity or blanket denial of passage are now relatively few, clearly identifiable and largely localized. In parallel, there has been a deterioration in terms of bureaucratic impediments to a timely and efficient response. Of most recent concern is the growing trend for some district and Governorate level authorities to disregard the nationally-agreed procedures for obtaining access letters, with civil authorities as well as military actors demanding additional approvals be obtained locally. Anbar, Mosul, Salah al-Din and Kirkuk governorates all offer extensive examples of this practice. HUMANITARIANACCESS AND OPERATIONAL CAPACITYHumanitarian access to most areas of Iraq improved significantly in 2018. However, the complex and fractured post-ISIL operating environment requires humanitarian actors to redouble efforts to continue to be seen as neutral, impartial and free of political interference.PERCEIVED LEVELS OF ACCESS CONSTRAINTS BY DISTRICTLegendlow access constraints Medium access constraints High access constraints RutbasalmanNajafHatraBaijika'imBa'ajkutHeetzubairAnaRu'uaAmaraRamadisinjarkifriDaurBaladroozMosulBadraTikritTelafarRifa'iHaiAfaqErbilFallujaAkreToozkhanaqinAmedikalarHawijaMakhmurFaoHadithasoranDaquqkirkukNassriyaAzeziaHamzakerbalaqurnakhidhirAli Al-gharbishatraMaimounaBaladMahawilDokanChamchamalDiwaniyaThetharzakhosamarrasuwairakoisnjaqsumelFaresTilkaifChibayishRumaithakhalisHalabjashirqatPshdarsharbazhershaqlawaMada'insulaymaniyaDabeskahlaMergasurMidainashikhanHamdaniyaDahukBasrahHashimiyaRaniaNa'maniyaPenjwinMuqdadiyaAin Al-TamurkufaMahmoudiyaHindiyasuq Al-shoyokhHillashatt Al-ArabChomansamawaqal'at salehMusayabAbu Al-khaseebMejar Al-kabishamiyaBa'qubaTarmiakarkhManatheraDarbandihkanSource: OCHA, Humanitarian Access Severity Overview (Aug 2018)Acquiring visas is a complex and time-consuming process in Iraq. The total annual cost of the visa process to NGOs in Iraq in 2018 was conservatively estimated to cost over US$ 5 million.68 The processes for visas are poorly documented, change frequently and may be interpreted differently between various government agencies. For example, unexpected administrative changes in 2018 resulted in over 400 NGO international staff69 unable to attain visas for up to four months, with some unable to travel to their primary work locations. Likewise, the process for NGOs to obtain federal registration with the Directorate of NGOs in Baghdad has proven to be time-consuming. The number of international NGOs registered in Iraq has increased in 2018, but the NGO Coordination Committee for Iraq (NCCI) still lists over 20 NGOs waiting for registration.70 On a practical level, this constrains assistance in some governorates, but the human and financial cost of delayed humanitarian programming is difficult to calculate. On a positive note for 2018, all NCCI member humanitarian mine action NGOs have now received registration. Other bureaucratic challenges for NGOs include unpredictable changes in customs, access letters, labour law, and other issues. Consistent, streamlined, and well-documented regulations and processes continue to be an important prerequisite for effective humanitarian and recovery assistance. Operational CapacitySome 170 organizations (85 national NGOs, 74 international NGOs and eight UN entities) are currently active in 420 locations spanning across 107 districts.71 This is the biggest geographical reach of humanitarian partners since the beginning of crisis in 2014. In 2018, 2.9 million people out of 3.4 million people (85 per cent) targeted by humanitarian partners were reached with some form of humanitarian assistance provided by 171 partners.72 However, the response has not always been consistent with the severity of needs and planning targets. In 2018, humanitarian efforts were largely concentrated in Ninewa, where the needs were acute in a post-ISIL context. However, in Mosul alone, humanitarian partners reported reaching more than 500,000 people, eight times higher than the initial target of 62,000 people. Additionally, the vast majority of the humanitarian response to date focused on people displaced in formal camps (approximately 30 per cent of the 1.8 million people who remain displaced). Expanding assistance to out-of-camp population, particularly in 20 prioritized districts with the highest density of displaced people, is a priority for 2019.Between 2016 and 2018, all clusters and sectors experienced an overall reduction in the number of their HRP partners.73 However, only four clusters and sectors (Education, Food Security, Emergency Livelihoods and RRM) showed a consistent decline in the number of partners throughout the years. For WASH, Health and CCCM clusters and Cash Working Group, the number of partners peaked in 2017, with the biggest decrease noted in the WASH Cluster who adjusted carrying out their operations from 61 partners in 2017 to 35 partners in 2018. Compared to all clusters/sectors, only Shelter NFI Cluster shows an increase in number of partners in 2018, although it is minimal, from 24 to 26. Throughout the years, the Protection Cluster recorded the highest number of HRP partners, with 86 in 2016; 63 in 2017 and 62 in 2018.   (5) 45 95 145 195 245CCCMEducationEmergencyLivelihoodsFood SecurityHealthMPCProtectionRRMSNFIWASHHRP partner presence over the years (2016-2018)201620172018PARTNER PRESENCE BY DISTRICT 72964635571916292917243141142515212463331743002339271218139922842131502113312010138962822104206287210026452115122352410371129358444378419211111591814Legend0 - 56 - 1415 - 2528 - 3750 - 74Source: Iraq 2018 Humanitarian Dashboard.

These tools will integrate gender, age and protection lenses. The HRP strategic objectives will be monitored by the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT). The inter-cluster objectives will be monitored by the Inter-Cluster Coordination Group (ICCG) and the Information Management Working Group (IMWG), and the cluster objectives will be monitored by the clusters. The ICCG will monitor progress against operational commitments and conduct inter-cluster analyses. The IMWG will develop and implement efficient processes for collecting data that will form the basis for analysis. The cluster coordinators will monitor cluster progress with their partners in the field. In parallel, monitoring will also be undertaken by the Iraq Humanitarian Fund (IHF) as integral part of the Fund’s accountability framework. IHF’s achievements towards the 2019 HRP Strategic Objectives will be reported in their annual report in 2020.ReportingInformation gathered from the various monitoring frameworks will be presented to national and local authorities and made available on the Humanitarian Response website. Adjustments in operational strategies and activities will be made in discussion with the government. Reporting will take place on a monthly basis through a transparent humanitarian dashboard (3W) which monitors progress against overall and cluster strategic targets based on data from ActivityInfo, an online inter-agency reporting system. An annual dashboard will be published in early 2020 to include results achieved throughout 2019. Response monitoring and reporting will continue to be a standing agenda discussion at each ICCG meeting to ensure immediate adjustments. Half-way through the year, a Periodic Monitoring Report (PMR) will be published to inform the HCT and ICCG if adjustment of the response is required. The timing of this report will be sequenced to form the basis of the second standard allocation of the IHF. Community views are captured in the monitoring process. The Iraq IDP Information Centre (IIC) is a member of the ICCG; data and analysis from the IIC is presented to the ICCG on a monthly basis, and gaps and resolution rates are discussed to monitor and adjust the response as required. Humanitarian access during 2018 expanded significantly, increasing the ability of the humanitarian community to implement direct monitoring of humanitarian response and needs instead of remote options. This new ability is expected to increase the quality of data collection against cluster indicators. Any barriers to implementation due to access challenges will be monitored through reporting mechanisms of the Access Working Group. 050100150200250Low-riskMedium-riskHigh-riskCompletedOngoingRequiredCompleted*RequiredCompleted*RequiredPartner project risk rating* Include 2 feld visits and 17 financial spot checks conducted to verify suspicions of fraud and weak financial management.3967632635506017541930192Field monitoringFinancial spot checksAudits79826330494010PROGRESS ON RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES: All IHF projects processed to dateRESPONSEMONITORINGThe humanitarian community in Iraq has developed a robust information management and monitoring framework to track progress against programming objectives. It supports evidence-based decision making to address gaps and make real-time adjustments to humanitarian operations. In line with the Grand Bargain commitments, humanitarian partners committed to strengthen accountability for aid delivery through better accountability to affected people, as well as better monitoring and reporting of impact and reach in 2019. The Assessment Working Group (AWG) and the ICCG will harmonise assessment data collection based on the newly developed Common Database of Indicators to facilitate inter-cluster analysis. In 2019, the AWG and ICCG will ensure that information from assessments will better inform the humanitarian response. Risk Monitoring and Due Diligence The management of the IHF uses a risk-based approach to ensure that a thorough analysis of risks is undertaken and that adequate assurance modalities are identified to mitigate these risks. Risks are analysed at the level of the partner by undertaking due diligence activities, including financial spot checks, OCHA’s Humanitarian Financing Unit-led monitoring, and third-party monitoring audits. In addition, the IHF conducts comprehensive capacity assessments of partners and monitors partner performance in several key areas through the partner performance index. HUMANITARIAN PROGRAMME CYCLE TIMELINE3W DashboardMonitoring ReportHumanitarian Needs OverviewHumanitarian Response PlanJANDECNOVOCTSEPAUGJULJUNMAYAPRMARFEBJAN20192020Humanitarian partners will continue engaging with affected populations in different phases of the HPC, to ensure that humanitarian programming is informed by their feedback. Partners will focus on improving engagement with affected populations, using existing mechanisms such as the IIC, the CwC Task Force under the Protection Cluster, Community Resource Centres, the Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) Network, the Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Hotline, IDP camp-based feedback structures and cluster-specific feedback mechanisms.As humanitarians seek to increase accountability to affected populations, investments need to be made into channels of communication favoured by affected populations. According to surveys, affected populations prefer phone calls (51 per cent), face-to-face communication (47 per cent) and direct observations as modes of getting information.74 Affected populations have shown increasing preference for getting information from family and friends in areas of origin, local authorities and NGOs. About 37 per cent of IDPs in camps, 31 per cent of returnees and 24 per cent of IDPs in out-of-camp locations indicated feeling empowered to influence decisions affecting them.75 The HCT has accordingly introduced a requirement into the 2019 HRP that each project identify how it will promote accountability to affected people. Considering the high levels of community engagement activities at the project development stage, a structured analysis and discussion at the ICCG and HCT will be undertaken in 2019 to explore how to build better systems that link community feedback and adjustments to humanitarian programming. Tools and MechanismsThe IIC remains one of the most utilized complaints and feedback mechanism serving IDPs, returnees and host communities throughout Iraq. Calls to the Centre grew from 9,254 in November 2017 to 12,228 in November 2018. The average monthly rate for first call case resolution by the centre has remained at 92.2 per cent from January to October 2018. For issues referred to partners that the centre was unable to resolve, less than 45 per cent were responded to, a very similar figure to that of 2017. This is despite improved engagement by partners, and a sustained push for collective accountability practices to respond to the requests.CRCs serve as information and referral hubs for community members to access information and referral on available services. The CRCs also offer workspaces to service delivery agents: governmental, international and non-governmental institutions. A total of 12 CRCs were established in 2018.76 Partners will establish 21 CRCs77 in 2019 so that more people can directly access information and referral services.The PSEA response continues to evolve and improve, especially through the dedicated work of the Iraqi PSEA Network. The Network receives SEA-related complaints and referrals through the IIC, which are reported to the Humanitarian Coordinator for follow-up and to the GBV sub-cluster for survivor-centred response. The Network will continue to strengthen its referral mechanisms and pathways, expand its scope through expansion of its membership to include NGOs, and delivery of PSEA mainstreaming sessions. For leadership and advocacy, the Network will design and roll out an advocacy strategy with the HCT and relevant stakeholders for preventing and addressing SEA. A helpline for GBV survivors has been established in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. GBV survivors receive confidential support, counselling and referrals to community-based services and resources in the region through this 24-hour helpline. It connects callers with trained social workers, legal and psycho-social support counsellors. The CwC Taskforce will continue to coordinate AAP and CwC interventions. Information campaigns will be conducted on a wide range of issues.Capacity building for partners in centre-south Iraq will continue to improve on coverage of CwC which was reported as low in the 2019 HNO. The Mine Action Sub-Cluster will refer affected populations to the Civil Defence and Directorate of Mine Action hotlines, as well as UNMAS EH reporting tool and other humanitarian MA partners, when appropriate.ACCOUNTABILITY TO AFFECTED POPULATIONSAffected people are empowered to continue participating in decisions and processes that impact them, providing feedback and influencing decision making in the implementation of humanitarian interventions in Iraq.All the activities under the 2019 Iraq HRP have been prioritized through a strategic review. It includes a total of 183 projects that will aim to reach 1.75 million people and as a complement to the Government’s humanitarian response efforts, and in parallel the UNCT’s Recovery and Resilience Programme (RRP). The estimated cost of these activities is US$ 701 million. Humanitarian partners intend to re-examine all aspects of the operation, including strategic objectives, cluster strategies and operational modalities by mid-2019. 2019 HRP projects were developed to facilitate mainstreaming of priority cross-cutting issues. All projects include a protection risk analysis and mitigation measures; 79 per cent of projects significantly contribute to gender equality and including across age groups; and 76 per cent of projects target youth. SUMMARY OFNEEDS, TARGETS & REQUIREMENTS PEOPLE IN NEED6.7MPEOPLE TARGETED1.75MREQUIREMENTS (US$)701MTOTALBREAKDOWN OF PEOPLE TARGETEDBY SEX & AGE*REQUIREMENTS IDPs ReturneesFood Security Water, Sanitationand Hygiene Protection HealthCamp Coordination andCamp Management Shelter and NFIEducation Multi-PurposeCash Assistance % Female % children, adult, elderlyTotal in US$ (million)Peopletargeted% PINtargeted Emergency LivelihoodsHostcommunity22%31%55%45%38%82%18%1%26%494950495052494041166.0M60.9M75.5M114.3M74.4M34.5M35.5M9.3M114.8M43 | 51 | 651 | 44 | 550 | 45 | 540 | 56 | 451 | 44 | 553 | 43 | 4100 | | 0 | 98 | 248 | 49 | 3*Children (<18 years old), adult (16-59 years), elderly(>59 years).1.004M0.502M0.369M0.133M1.720M1.049M0.483M0.188M1.272M0.612M0.500M0.160M1.125M0.712M0.375M0.038M0.882M0.550M0.324M0.008M0.765M0.540M0.210M0.015M0.462M0.240M0.193M0.028M0.031M0.005M0.019M0.007M0.740M0.381M0.317M0.042MKURDISTANREGION OF IRAQPEOPLE IN NEEDREQUIREMENTS (US$)# HUMANITARIANPARTNERSPEOPLE TARGETEDINTERNALLY DISPLACEDPEOPLE1.2M39109M0.5M347KPARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS IN 2019PEOPLE WHO NEED HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCEINTERNALLY DISPLACED PEOPLEVULNERABLE HOST COMMUNITIESRETURNEESREFUGEES$STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 3STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 1STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 2Strengthening contingency planning and preparedness. Post-conflict transitiontowards durable solutions.Ensuring the Centrality of Protection. 721K127K45K241K50,000100,00020,00050,000100,00030,000100,00040ErbilsulaymaniyahDahuk2926401.2MErbilsulaymaniyahDahukThis map shows the number and presence of organizationsappealing through the Humanitarian Response Plan 2019.Numbers per governorate are not mutually exclusive, an organization may operate in more than one governorate.0.49M0.48M0.19MHUMANITARIAN RESPONSE PLANAT A GLANCEA signifiant proportion of the 1.8 million displaced people in Iraq have sought safety in the three governorates (Dahuk, Erbil and Sulaymaniyah) of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), both in camps and in out-of-camp settings. The majority of IDPs in KRI live in out-of-camp settings, and 40 per cent IDPs in this group reside in host communities.78 In three districts 79 in Dahuk governorate, 115 informal settlements have been home for 25,000 IDPs for more than four years. This is the highest number of informal settlements in any one governorate across Iraq.80While displaced people have demonstrated remarkable resilience, their coping capacity may be exhausted, especially for those in protracted displacement. Pressure on the provision of basic services and full access to social safety nets as well as financial, technical and security challenges faced by the local populations81 continue to frustrate vulnerable people from rebuilding their lives and achieving durable solutions. The majority of IDPs currently in camps in KRI do not intend to return to their areas of origin within the next 12 months,82 which may result in further strains on resouces. In many camps, tents are worn-out, water and sanitation services need to be increased, access to health and education services needs to be improved and livelihood programmes need to be expanded. Given the protracted nature of displacement in KRI, there is a need to look for longer-term solutions for these camps. A gradual transition toward social safety nets is considered the way forward for certain sectors, such as food assistance and MPCA. However, some issues will continue to require assistance from sectoral partners, such as the shortage of essential medicines, the diminished functionality of some public health facilities, the integration of IDPs in prolonged out-of-camp situations, and the provision of education and livelihood assistance to vulnerable host communities. The Joint Crisis Coordination Centre (JCC), headquartered in Erbil, leads the response in coordination with relevant authorities, and international humanitarian partners work in collaboration with the JCC to find the most suitable solutions for affected people. Approximately 0.9 million people (displaced people, returnees and host communities) living in Dahuk, Erbil and Sulaymaniyah governorates are estimated to require some form of assistance in 2019. Four out of 21 districts in the KRI present high or very high severity of needs, and host more than half of the total population in need in KRI approximately 400,000 people in Sumel and Zakho (Dahuk); 56,000 people in Makhmur (Erbil); and 133,000 people in Sulaymaniya (Sulaymaniyah).83 IDPs and vulnerable host communities residing in these locations are estimated to have unmet needs in multiple sectors. The severity of needs in Erbil is assessed to be moderate, however, the district hosts the highest number of people in need in all of KRI (approximately 321,000 people, including a third of all refugees). The remaining 173,000 people in need are scattered in districts with moderate, low or very low severity of needs.84 Dahuk, Erbil and Sulaymaniyah are hosting a large majority from the first waves of displacement in 2014 and 2015. Earlier waves of displacement have shown generally slower rate of return, in part because IDPs were able to access locations that are stable and may be less willing now to give up the improved quality of life gained in these areas.85 While some are at risk of protracted displacement, others may require support in obtaining durable solutions, including local integration with the host community or relocation. CRISISOVERVIEW AND IMPACTThe Kurdistan Region of Iraq continues to protect and support displaced people and host communities.BREAKDOWN OFPEOPLE IN NEEDMore than a third of the total 1.8 million displaced people and nearly all of the 250,000 Syrians refugees in Iraq continue to seek a place of safety in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.Among the three governorates, Dahuk has the largest overall number of out-of-camp IDPs, while Erbil and Sulaymaniyah have extremely high ratios of IDPs living in out-of-camp settings. Some 87 per cent and 91 per cent of all IDPs in Erbil and Sulaymaniyah are living outside of camps. In Dahuk, 14 per cent of the total IDPs (48,186 individuals) are living in critical shelters.86 The three governorates are also hosting some 170,000 people in 30 formal camps in KRI,87 who do not intend to return to their areas of origin within the next 12 months or are unsure of their future plans.88 IDPS AND RETURNEES LOCATION

Cluster’s response strategy includes five pillars, calibrated for the evolving context in 2019: (i) delivery of assistance to most vulnerable segments of the internally displaced people (IDP), returnee and host populations, including prioritization of persons with perceived affiliation to extremist groups, while continuing to support traditional vulnerable groups i.e. female-headed households, at-risk children and adolescents, persons with disabilities or chronic conditions, older persons, as well as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex (LGBTQI) persons all

sustained interventions; (ii) the scale-up of outreach and services in out-of-camp locations (which were under-served in 2018) i.e. at-risk out-of-camp IDPs in informal settlements and urban areas, and vulnerable returnees in areas of origin; (iii) greater emphasis on community-based protection modalities in 2019, as a means to empower communities to participate in and take greater ownership of their own protection; (iv) addressing barriers to durable solutions, to facilitate access to longer-term solutions; and (v) mainstreaming of protection principles and standards, and/or integration of protection programming across prioritized clusters/sectors, while expanding such interventions to encompass recovery and development actors, thereby strengthening the humanitarian-development nexus. To implement these pillars, the Cluster has higher financial requirements for 2019, due to several operational, capacity and procedural changes.89 The Cluster will contribute to the Durable Solutions Framework for Iraq, to be jointly developed by humanitarian, recovery and development actors in 2019; engage with recovery actors to advocate for timely response to needs identified through RPAs and other community-level assessments, and work with such actors to mainstream protection principles and standards.Collectively, general protection, Housing, Land and Property (HLP) and Mine Action partners will focus their interventions in a total of 65 districts in 2019, with the majority concentrated in Ninewa, Salah al-Din, Anbar, Baghdad and Kirkuk governorates for general protection and HLP partners; and Ninewa, Anbar, Kirkuk, Diyala and Salah al-Din for Mine Action partners. Gender-Based Violence (GBV) partners’ interventions will focus on a total of 62 districts, mostly concentrated in Ninewa, Anbar, Kirkuk, Salah al-Din and Dahuk governorates; while Child Protection (CP) partners will focus their interventions on a total of 33 districts, with the majority concentrated in Ninewa, Anbar, Salah-al-Din, Kirkuk and Dahuk governorates. Compared to 2018, the protection response will have an increased focus on high-density out-of-camp IDP and returnee locations. The bulk of Protection Cluster’s interventions will support provision of immediate services to affected populations, including support to transition to durable solutions. Cluster partners will undertake protection mainstreaming and advocacy interventions to ensure operationalization of the centrality of protection; and contribute to preparedness through mainstreaming of protection into inter-agency preparedness plans.General Protection (GP)Partners will establish or support static community centres (operated by protection partners), and deploy mobile services, particularly benefitting out-of-camp IDPs and returnees. In community centers, vulnerable individuals will receive specialized protection services, including awareness raising; legal assistance on documentation, detention and family law matters; and psycho-social support. Mobile teams will conduct household-level protection monitoring, community-level assessments, awareness raising and legal assistance activities. Partners will undertake community-based protection interventions, including communication with communities on rights, entitlements and availability of assistance; the establishment of/or support to community groups to undertake protection activities; and peaceful co-existence activities in areas of displacement. GP partners will address barriers to durable solutions through ongoing monitoring of and advocacy for principled returns and relocations during camp consolidation/closure; the provision of legal assistance on civil documentation, to ensure proof of legal identity, facilitate access to government social protection mechanisms, and meet residency requirements; and legal aid on arbitrary detention cases to facilitate family reunification. Partners will strengthen inter-sectoral interventions. Focus will be on capacity-building of GP actors on psycho-social support with the Mental Health & Psycho-Social Support (MHPSS) Task Force; and engagement with Cash Working Group on referral of cash assistance beneficiaries to legal assistance on documentation and case management services. Partners will also strengthen the capacities of authorities, NGOs and local communities to contribute to a favorable protection environment, through trainings and technical support. Finally, the Cluster will engage in evidence-based advocacy to address prioritized protection challenges, in partnership with the NCCI’s Advocacy Working Group. Housing, Land and Property (HLP) The HLP sub-cluster will provide targeted legal assistance to 9,690 persons, including those with perceived affiliation to extremist groups, female-headed households, and other vulnerable groups, who face discriminatory barriers in exercising their HLP rights. This will be coupled with high-level advocacy to address systemic barriers. For 26,230 out-of-camp IDPs and returnees, legal assistance and awareness raising on HLP will be scaled-up through static community centres or mobile teams. Partners will also ensure access to community-based dispute resolution and ownership verification mechanisms to resolve HLP disputes, particularly where formal courts have not been restored, or are otherwise inaccessible. Given the limited number of specialized HLP partners, the sub-cluster will strengthen the capacities of existing and new partners on HLP compensation and restitution mechanisms, through trainings and publication of operational guidance. HLP partners will work towards the realization of durable solutions through the provision of legal assistance to restore HLP ownership documentation, resolve secondary occupation cases, and file HLP compensation claims. The sub-cluster will coordinate with the Shelter/NFI Cluster and their stabilization and recovery counterparts to ensure that HLP considerations are adequately taken into account, thereby contributing to security of tenure. The sub-cluster will strengthen engagement with the GBV sub-cluster to document the barriers faced by displaced and returnee women particularly female-headed households in exercising their HLP rights.Mine Action (MA)The sub-cluster will advocate for non-discriminatory, conflict-sensitive prioritization, and operationally efficient implementation of MA activities, as well as the use of specialized equipment to neutralize explosive hazards (EH). EH risk education and victim assistance services, including through mobile teams, will be delivered to 272,842 IDPs, returnees, and host communities. MA partners will engage with community groups on risk education (pre-departure from areas of displacement, and upon arrival in areas of origin); strengthen explosive hazard identification and reporting; and ensure timely and appropriate MA response, including referrals to victim assistance services. They will continuously engage with host community and the vulnerable non-displaced who may be at risk from unexploded ordinance. They will address barriers to safe and durable solutions posed by extensive explosive hazard contamination, through survey, clearance, risk education and victim assistance, in coordination with the relevant national MA authorities. The sub-cluster will build the capacities and systems of MA authorities and partners, through trainings and technical support. The sub-cluster will strengthen inter-sectoral linkages through mainstreaming of MA considerations among all clusters/sectors, as EH survey and clearance activities enable all humanitarian interventions, and particularly with Health Cluster to scale up victim assistance services. The sub-cluster will ensure a coordinated response to residential EH survey and clearance activities; and work with the Child Protection, Education and CCCM Clusters to ensure that children benefit from risk education in camps, out-of-camp community centres and learning spaces.Gender-based Violence (GBV) The sub-cluster will ensure access to GBV services for 763,856 survivors and those at-risk, particularly women and girls with perceived affiliation to extremist groups, female-headed households, vulnerable men and boys, and child survivors. In prioritized locations, partners will provide comprehensive GBV services through 151 static centres in camps, host communities and areas of origin, and 38 mobile teams targeting vulnerable out-of-camp IDPs, host and returnee populations. In priority locations where there are barriers to accessing services, GBV services will be integrated into reproductive health facilities to ensure accessibility. Partners will increase their focus on community engagement for GBV prevention, mitigation and response, with awareness raising activities involving the whole community, with a focus on engagement of men and boys, in order to ensure greater utilization of available services. Partners will address barriers to durable solutions through working with legal aid partners to ensure survivors’ access to documentation, government social protection mechanisms, residency permits, and the lasting resolution of family law disputes. The sub-cluster will engage with recovery actors and advocate for their GBV interventions to align with the technical standards set by the sub-cluster. The sub-cluster will mainstream GBV across other clusters/sectors through roll-out of trainings on the IASC GBV in Emergencies Guidelines, and GBV SOPs. It will also bolster cooperation with: legal aid actors to ensure access to legal support; the CP sub-cluster to coordinate response to child survivors; the MHPSS Task Force to strengthen response to GBV survivors’ needs; and livelihood actors to increase livelihood opportunities for vulnerable women and girls. The sub-cluster will strengthen the capacity of government institutions and national NGOs through training and mentorship to expand coverage in under-served areas, and improve quality of service provision. The sub-cluster will prioritize evidence-based advocacy, targeting civilian authorities, and ensure timely operational response to identified needs and risks.Child Protection (CP) Partners will continue strengthening case management services, targeting 25,956 of the most vulnerable children, including those with perceived affiliation to extremist groups. Partners will focus on effective and updated referral pathways and capacity-building of front-line service providers, especially national NGOs and government actors. Partners aim to reach vulnerable children in out-of-camp displacement and return areas through schools and community centres. Shifting from static child friendly spaces with recreational programmes in camps, partners will integrate structured psycho-social support in learning spaces, and keep children safe in schools by training teachers and social workers in schools.Children aged 12-17 comprise 68 per cent of out-of-school children, and are more vulnerable to risks such as child labour, child marriage, recruitment into armed forces and groups, sexual exploitation and abuse, and arbitrary detention. Peer-to-peer approaches and community-based centres will be used as entry points to reach such out-of-school adolescents. In 2019, CP partners will strengthen protective family and community-based environments; particular focus will be on structured parenting programmes, and capacity-building of community-based group members to prevent and respond to CP risks, thereby contributing to positive behaviour changes towards children. Partners will also work with government authorities to establish formal linkages with community-based protection mechanisms for sustainability.An estimated 45,000 children are in need of civil documentation, and without legal identity they cannot access education and health services in areas such as Ninewa, Anbar, Kirkuk and Salah al-Din. CP partners will scale up civil documentation support and legal assistance for children, including those in detention who require specialized assistance such as legal services, social case work, and tailored psycho-social support. Partners will contribute to ongoing advocacy for the best interests of children irrespective of their perceived affiliation, family status, or (dis)ability in order to remove barriers, reduce stigma, and support their integration. CP programming will be integrated with livelihoods and education interventions, as part of a strategic approach to mitigate CP risks, which are heightened due to the economic vulnerability of families. By integrating households with children at risk in livelihoods programming, and strengthening referral pathways. Exit strategy••Transition service delivery from international to national NGOs, with a focus on supporting national partners to identify and manage complex cases requiring specialized protection assistance, and conduct targeted advocacy with relevant authorities on protection issues.••Build capacity of community-based protection mechanism to identify local-level protection needs and risks, contribute to long-term behaviour change, and advocate with relevant authorities to address identified needs.••Build the capacity of government authorities to deliver protection assistance, while adhering to protection principles and minimum standards. For instance, GBV partners will provide capacity-building and technical support to MoLSA and the Directorate for Combatting Violence Against Women (DCVAW); and child protection partners will expand their capacity-building support to the Ministry of Education social workforce, in addition to MoLSA and the Ministry of Justice. ••Work with recovery actors to mainstream protection principles, technical standards and operational approaches, thereby strengthening the humanitarian-development nexus.Accountability to Affected People••Provide individuals with information on their rights and entitlements, and how to access assistance through the Communication with Communities (CwC) Task Force.••Engage with national-level mechanisms such as the IDP Information Centre (IIC), the PSEA Network, and provide timely response . ••Continue the GBV sub-cluster’s 24-hour helpline for GBV survivors in Kurdistan Region of Iraq allowing them to receive confidential and specialized support and counselling, as well as referrals to community-based services; while the Mine Action sub-cluster refer affected populations to the Civil Defence Explosive Hazard hotline, and the UNMAS explosive hazard reporting tool. Protection risks and mitigation measures••Girls, boys, women and men with perceived affiliation to extremist groups have often been subject to discriminatory denial of assistance e.g. access to documentation and HLP compensation mechanisms, explosive hazard clearance prioritization and movement restrictions, arbitrary detention, as well as sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA). Protection actors will advocate for needs-based, non-discriminatory access to assistance, lifting of movement restrictions, release from detention, and accountability in SEA cases. ••Forced and premature returns, forced evictions from informal settlements, pose protection risks. Wherever possible, protection actors will remain operationally agile to deliver mobile protection monitoring services in areas of origin and secondary displacement, and mine action actors will deliver explosive hazard risk education in displacement sites at-risk of eviction, consolidation or closure.••To address barriers to access resulting from stigma associated with accessing GBV services, GBV activities will be integrated into other sectorial interventions. ••Privacy and confidentiality of vulnerable individuals particularly in GBV and child protection cases can be compromised during identification and referral to specialized assistance. Established GBV information sharing protocols (including informed consent) will be reinforced in 2019. Similarly, Child Protection Sub Cluster will continue to roll out its new information management platform for case management in 2019, with a strengthened information management protocol to ensure confidentiality. Response strategy The Health Cluster will continue providing IDPs, returnees in areas of high severity, and highly vulnerable people (including women, children and the elderly among host communities) with quality essential health care services. This includes treatment of common diseases; vaccination; nutrition screening, referral and treatment; reproductive health services; and referrals of complicated cases (both emergency and non-emergency), with a focus on mental health and psychosocial support services, physical rehabilitation of amputees and those wounded during armed conflict who have sustained disabilities, and clinical management of rape and Gender-Based Violence (GBV) survivors. The primary focus of health service delivery will be the IDP camps. The service-provision will be tailored according to the population size, i.e., those with more than 5,000 people will be served by static Primary Health Care Centres (PHCCs) within the camp, while those camps with less than 5,000 people will be served by mobile teams, or through a health partner-supported public PHCC in the nearby community. The Cluster will also target displaced people in out-of-camp locations and host communities in 20 prioritized locations by supporting the government PHC facilities through minor revitalization, medicine supply and capacity-building. For the priority return areas, populations will be targeted through supporting public health facilities, referrals of complicated services to advanced facilities and communicable disease surveillance. The Cluster’s support to health facilities will go together with the stabilization programme of UNDP, through which hospitals and major PHCCs are being rehabilitated in a four-year (two-phase) plan.Contingency planning for new conflict-induced displacement, partners will provide public health services to newly-displaced persons through both mobile clinics and static PHCCs. In the event of a natural disaster, subject to a rapid needs assessment partners will deploy mobile medical teams, refer emergency/complicated cases to advanced facilities and provide emergency health kits as required. The Cluster will work to avert outbreaks of communicable diseases through the disease Early Warning, Alert and Response Network (eWARN) in Anbar, Baghdad, Dahuk, Diyala, Erbil, Kerbala, Kirkuk, Najaf, Ninewa, Salah al-Din and Sulaymaniyah governorates, while conducting health promotion sessions to at risk communities. Health actors will preposition kits at hot-spot locations based on disease trend analysis. In the event of an outbreak, rapid response teams will be deployed to conduct sampling, laboratory detection, case management and treatment. PEOPLE IN NEED5.5MHEALTHPEOPLE TARGETED1.7MREQUIREMENTS (US$)60.9M# OF PARTNERS23HEALTH OBJECTIVE 1:1Continue to provide quality essential health care services, including mental health and psychosocial support services, physical rehabilitation and management of GBV survivors, targeting IDPs and highly vulnerable persons.HEALTH OBJECTIVE 22Strengthen the national capacity in crisis-affected areas and continue to advocate for handover of humanitarian health service-delivery.HEALTH OBJECTIVE 33Monitor, mitigate and manage common communicable diseases through ensuring the continuity of an effective early warning and response mechanism and health awareness.BREAKDOWN OF PEOPLE IN NEED AND TARGETED BY STATUS, SEX AND AGE % Female BY STATUSBY SEX & AGE** % Children, adult, elderlyPEOPLE IN NEEDPEOPLE TARGETEDFINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS# Internally displaced people# Highly vulnerable returnees# Hostcommunity$60.9 M**Children (<18 years old), adult (18-59 years), elderly (>59 years)515149491.7M1.05M3.5M0.48M0.35M0.19M444455* Figures provided under this category include host communities and non-displaced in newly accessible areas.CONTACTDr. Fawad Khan,khanmu@who.intDr. Kamal Olleri, kolleri@international medicalcorps.orgCross-cutting issues such as GBV mainstreaming and physical rehabilitation of the disabled and mental health will be given more focus to ensure quality health services. The cluster will strengthen the secondary healthcare services and improve referrals between primary and secondary levels. These, however, entail a higher cost per beneficiary than what was calculated in 2018, where the Cluster was just beginning to adequately incorporate cross-cutting issues. There will be an increased focus on strengthening national capacity based on the lessons of 2018. This includes both governmental and non-governmental agencies through training and capacity-building activities while continuing to advocate for handover of health service-delivery to the Directorate of Health (DoH). Capacity building activities will focus on: eWARN, case management of communicable diseases, rational use of medicines, implementing basic quality standards in primary healthcare services and appropriate methods of conducting physical rehabilitation of disabled people. The main challenge in responsible transition is relevant authorities’ financial and human resources readiness to take over PHCCs in camps. Because this is over and above the existing health system, which in itself, is not adequately staffed nor receiving regular budget. Therefore, the Cluster will regularly follow up with the MoH on their strategy for 2019 and the suitable timeline for them to take over services during the year.Operational planDisplaced people in camps, temporary, formal and informal settlements••Provide PHC services through mobile and static facilities, including outpatient consultations; immunization; reproductive health services; communicable disease surveillance and management; clinical assessment and management of mental health cases; clinical management of rape (where services are available) and referral to the Protection Cluster; and the provision of assistive devices to amputees. ••For camps with populations less than 5,000, either mobile teams will be deployed or a public PHCC in the vicinity will be supported so that IDPs may have access to free services. The displaced population will be informed of the available services. Although the SPHERE standards, recommends a static PHC clinic for a population of 10,000 individuals, camps with a minimum population of 5,000 individuals will be supported with static PHCCs within the camp as the capacity of the federal Director of Health is over-stretched. ••Refer complicated emergency cases to accessible and functional hospitals near the camps and settlements, if available. ••Refer non-emergency cases to the nearest hospital through vehicles/transport cost provided by partners.••Ensure an uninterrupted supply of essential medicines and emergency health kits to priority locations, mainly focusing on the 55 IDP camps and 20 prioritized districts.••Conduct Quality of Care assessments periodically for 55 camps with population more than 1,000 people, to ensure basic minimum quality standards are being maintained. Returnees and vulnerable host communities••Provide temporary support such as minor revitalization and running of PHCCs and hospitals in the areas of return. This will be done in parallel with the stabilization programme, which is supporting infrastructure rehabilitation, providing equipment and training for the staff. This approach, however, needs to go hand in hand with the simultaneous availability of other basic services, including protection, clean water, electricity, food, education, and livelihoods to facilitate safe and dignified returns.Exit strategy••Hand over/integration of emergency health services to the governorate level DoH, depending on readiness, capacity and agreed timeline and to continually liaise with the Ministry of Health and DoH to align humanitarian interventions with Government’s allocated budget. The Ministry of Health is committed to support IDP camps in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq by increasing the allocated medication by an estimated 7 per cent. However, this will take time and is not applicable to all camps.••Strengthen national capacity (governmental and NGOs) through training and capacity-building activities, and the prepositioning of emergency kits, IV fluids and lab reagents at hot-spot locations.••Coordinate with the stabilization programme to support basic service-provision in locations where both stabilization and humanitarian partners work as needed, and to divert resources to other locations where such assistance is required under the humanitarian-development nexus.Accountability to Affected People••Prioritise improved problem resolution rates for referrals from the IDP Call Centre. ••Use CwC Task Force to disseminate messages on public health and information on available services to the most vulnerable groups. ••Use the RPAs and RNAs to understand the immediate needs of people in areas unassessed or areas where the humanitarian situation shifted unexpectedly. ••Continue the Quality of Care tool to measure patient satisfaction on services provided by the health partner to improve the satisfaction rates, where necessary. Protection risks and mitigation measures••Attacks on health personnel or facilities may occur. WHO’s Monitoring Events on Healthcare Safe Use and Access (MEASURES) programme will continue to track incidents and report to the appropriate authorities.••Restricted access to certain locations, due to sudden onset or prolonged security/access issues, in areas such as Basrah, Hawija, southern Mosul, may limit appropriate service-delivery. The Cluster will coordinate with the DoH and partners at the sub-national level to deliver the required assistance, while maintaining the safety of staff. ••The Cluster will have a zero-tolerance approach to discrimination in providing services to people with perceived affiliations and/or those marginalized due to ethnic differences. The Cluster will continuously monitor and take appropriate action against any partners whose workers are found to engage in such practices. ••Situations, where arms are brought into health facilities in camps, will be taken up with the Protection and CCCM Clusters to take the appropriate steps. ••Survivors of GBV will be provided with the suitable treatment and counselling before being referred to the GBV partner. Response strategy The WASH Cluster will focus on improving and sustaining quality of WASH services to targeted people in 33 prioritized locations. For IDPs in camps,90 WASH support will include the upgrade, operation and maintenance of water and sanitation facilities, and enhancing sound hygiene practices. For sustainability the cluster will invest in cost effective and durable solutions to issues of water supply, wastewater treatment and solid waste management. The Cluster will prioritize meeting high standards in terms of the access to, and quality and quantity of water supply, especially in camps in Ninewa, Anbar and Salah al-Din. The Cluster will also work to the ensure privacy, dignity and security for women and girls and access for people with special needs or disabilities. The Cluster will support local authorities and relevant clusters with camp closure/consolidation, specifically with the decommissioning of water and sanitation infrastructure to meet environmental health standards. For IDPs in out-of-camp locations, returnees and vulnerable host communities in four prioritized governorates,91 the WASH Cluster will continue to restore basic levels of water and sanitation services through the limited rehabilitation of dysfunctional water and sanitation facilities (e.g. water stations, water treatment plants) and short-term water trucking. The Cluster will advocate for a longer-term improvement of water and sanitation facilities, while strengthening the capacity of local authorities to take ownership of facilities through regular operation and maintenance. Emphasis is on linking humanitarian WASH interventions with recovery/ reconstruction and development partners.The WASH cluster will continue to meet the critical lifesaving WASH needs of an estimated 254,417 affected people in areas that may experience displacement or with critically limited WASH services due to natural hazards, waterborne diseases or other shocks. Emergency WASH services shall include emergency water supply, temporary sanitation facilities, hygiene items and contextually appropriate hygiene awareness to mitigate increased public health risks. Additionally, the WASH Cluster shall advocate for prepositioning of contingency stocks and will support the development/update of contingency plans in coordination and with other sectors. In emerging locations92 with acute water stress due to meteorological and climatic variabilities, the WASH cluster will advocate for disaster risk reductions and management as integral WASH programming to build the resilience of the most vulnerable people.PEOPLE IN NEED2.3MWATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENEPEOPLE TARGETED1.3MREQUIREMENTS (US$)75.5M# OF PARTNERS24WASH OBJECTIVE 1:1Continue to improve, upgrade and sustain quality and standards of water and sanitation services, and provide an enabling environment for good hygiene practices in protracted displacement (in camps).WASH OBJECTIVE 22Continue to restore basic water and sanitation services and support good hygiene practices for highly vulnerable populations in areas of return and host communities, and facilitate hand over of care and maintenance of water and sanitation facilities to local authorities.WASH OBJECTIVE 33Provide safe and accessible emergency water and sanitation services and support good hygiene practices for highly vulnerable populations in any new displacement areas, high risk areas and during shocksWASH OBJECTIVE 44Promote sustainable and cost-effective water and sanitation services including community focused hygiene promotion in and out of camps locations.BREAKDOWN OF PEOPLE IN NEED AND TARGETED BY STATUS, SEX AND AGE % Female BY STATUSBY SEX & AGE** % Children, adult, elderly PEOPLE IN NEEDPEOPLE TARGETEDFINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS# Internally displacedpeople# Highly vulnerable returnees# Hostcommunity$75.5M**Children (<18 years old), adult (18-59 years), elderly (>59 years)505049500.66M0.61M1.34M0.5M0.2M0.16M454555* Figures provided under this category include host communities and non-displaced in newly accessible areas.CONTACTPeter Lukwiya,pplukwiya@unicef.orgAmmar Orakzai, Ammar.Orakzai@nca.noThe WASH Cluster will prioritize piloting of new innovations in public and communal WASH interventions, while considering cross-cutting issues such as reducing instances of GBV, and assuring accessibility for persons living with disability and the elderly. This includes building the capacities of local authorities to take over operation and maintenance of water and sanitation facilities and promoting the use of cash, wherever relevant. The Cluster will strengthen public and private WASH service delivery in host communities, and promote integrated WASH interventions (WASH in schools/health facilities) to increase impact.

The majority of needs are concentrated in Diyala, Ninewa, Dahuk, Anbar and Erbil governorates. This transition is the key change from the cluster activities in previous years, which were primarily focused on emergency response, and reflects shifting needs considering reduced security constraints, an increased number of returnees, and the Cluster assumption that government social safety will begin to move towards pre-conflict status over the course of 2019.The Cluster will target 712,000 displaced people in 2019. The continuation of food assistance to 460,000 people in camps will remain a critical need at least until the end of 2019, although it is expected to decrease as camps consolidate and close. Approximately 89 per cent of IDP households in camps do not intend to return to their areas of origin or are unsure of their future plans93. Food assistance modalities to IDPs in-camp are almost equally split between cash-based transfers (CBT) and in-kind assistance; 45 per cent of the 130 camps served by WFP are currently on CBT modalities. Each household will receive monthly assistance designed to provide a nutritionally balanced basket for a family of five for 30 days. Food assistance is currently given to all IDPs in the camps served by WFP. With Government assistance to in-camp IDPs becoming more predictable, avoidance of dual distributions will be carefully managed.The out-of-camp displaced population assessed as food insecure or vulnerable to food insecurity is approximately 300,000 people in Diyala, Kirkuk, Anbar, Salah al-Din and Erbil governorates. Rural livelihood and resilience-building projects, concentrating around infrastructure rehabilitation and replacement of basic assets at the communal and household level will increase in 2019. The scale-up of livelihood support, provision of agricultural inputs and service activities are key elements of reaching out to displaced people in out-of-camp locations.In 2019, one cross-cutting approach to food security will be the implementation of agricultural transition activities in returnee areas with high severity of need. A total of 380,000 returnees and 38,000 people in local communities are estimated to be food insecure. The governorates with the highest number of food insecure returnee populations are Salah Al-Din (76,000), Ninewa (162,000), Diyala (20,000) and Anbar (63,000).

The Cluster will also work with protection partners to review the modality of cash in food security to ensure that it does not increase beneficiaries’ vulnerability. WFP, as the largest partner, has protection protocols in place for partners to follow.••Helpdesks, hotlines and Communication with Communities will be regularly utilized as means of protection mainstreaming, and the Cluster will continue its robust training schedule on PSEA, GBV and AAP in 2019.••Unanticipated pipeline breaks in food distribution could temporarily increase food security risks for vulnerable beneficiaries. The Cluster lead agency is supporting the Government of Iraq in the modernization of the Public Distribution System (PDS), Iraq’s biggest social safety net, which provides food entitlements to almost the entire population. This digitization effort should reduce processing time, helping to mitigate and minimize future disruptions in food provision.Response strategy There are 2.35 million people in need of basic shelter and essential NFI assistance.94 Damage or looting of residential housing is one of the top-three barriers to durable return.95 Living in substandard dwellings is one of the top three conditions associated with socio-economic vulnerabilities.96 Unmet shelter needs worsen protection risks: 23 per cent of people require support to restore privacy and dignity, while 21 per cent have safety and security concerns.97 The 2019 strategy of the Shelter and NFI (SNFI) Cluster will support 0.9 million most vulnerable conflict-affected people through shelter and household items assistance, directly contributing toward durable solutions, and indirectly contributing to protection mainstreaming by minimizing associated risks: if residents’ security of tenure is reinforced, their feelings of dignity strengthened, and their safety improved, then secondary displacement and negative coping mechanisms avoided.The identification of beneficiaries will be strengthened through a more targeted approach, moving away from status-based alone to strategic prioritization. The nature of activities is not changing significantly compared to previous years. Priority is given to highly vulnerable people in critical shelter.98 In camps, new arrivals and vulnerable families99 will be prioritized. For out-of-camp locations, identification of vulnerabilities will be aligned with the socio-economic vulnerability assessment tool developed by the Cash Working Group, to allow greater consistency among beneficiary selection of partners’ programmes and thus reinforcing the principle of impartiality.In terms of geographical focus, humanitarian assistance is maintained in those camps where living conditions need continuous support to attain or maintain minimum standards,100 and in 31 priority districts101 showing the highest concentration of needs both in terms of severity and number of affected IDPs, returnees and host communities.102In areas of return, humanitarian partners can increase their relevance by moving away from large urban centres, where residual housing repairs needs for the highly vulnerable remain far larger than their capacity to provide an added value without excluding eligible cases. Instead, shelter partners will focus on smaller, peri-urban and rural centres, where the high poverty rate and the lack of large-scale stabilization support exacerbates the already minimal coping mechanisms of people to repair their residences. In these more scattered regions not targeted by development programmes, humanitarian interventions have the potential to mobilize communities and combine PEOPLE IN NEED2.35MSHELTER AND NON-FOOD ITEMSPEOPLE TARGETED0.9MREQUIREMENTS (US$)74.4M# OF PARTNERS16SNFIS OBJECTIVE 1:1Maintain adequate living conditions of vulnerable displaced people in camps through shelter and non-food items support.SNFIS OBJECTIVE 22Assist highly vulnerable people out of camp transitioning to durable solutions through the provision of adequate shelter and non-food items in priority areas of displacement and return.SNFIS OBJECTIVE 33Contribute to preparedness levels, contingency plans and capacities for large-scale emergencies through shelter interventions and NFI provisions.BREAKDOWN OF PEOPLE IN NEED AND TARGETED BY STATUS, SEX AND AGE % Female BY STATUSBY SEX & AGE* % Children, adult, elderly PEOPLE IN NEEDPEOPLE TARGETEDFINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS# Internally displaced people# Highly vulnerable returnees# Hostcommunity $74.4M*Children (<18 years old), adult (18-59 years), elderly (>59 years)515150500.71M0.55M0.99M0.32M0.39M0.008M444455CONTACTFrancesca Coloni,coord.iraq@sheltercluster.orgVacant,coord2.iraq@sheltercluster.orgsmall-scale multi-sectoral projects that would greatly complement housing rehabilitation and NFI support.This shift to a more targeted approach to support specific vulnerable groups in prioritized geographical areas through a socio-economic vulnerability assessment tool reflects the need to rationalize decreasing resources in a post-emergency response, while development plans contribute toward achieving longer-term, broader solutions. Humanitarian funds and well-established coordination mechanisms among all intervening stakeholders remain a prerequisite to efficiently achieve this strategy, and start preparing for a responsible disengagement as soon as feasible.Emergency preparedness capacity will be maintained by SNFI partners, in order to promptly fill in any gap to cover up to 130,000 potentially affected people.103Operational plan••Upgrade of IDP Camps: Until the government clarifies its longer-term plans, activities to transform camps into more permanent sites is not envisaged. Before any investment is made, a multi-sector cost-efficiency analysis should be undertaken and the return on investments carefully weighed against two main factors: the timeframe IDPs may stay, and the alternative solutions in areas of origin where humanitarian funds could alternatively be disbursed. Nonetheless, protection considerations should be taken into account before making any decision driven by technical and financial perspectives. ••Maintenance of minimum standards in IDP camps: Considering that 89 per cent of IDP households do not intend to return to their areas of origin or are unsure of their plans ,104 regular activities to attain or maintain minimum standards in living conditions remains paramount for 300,150 people. This includes regular maintenance of infrastructures (roads, drainage channels, electricity networks, etc.) and tent replacement105 for almost 22,600 families. Basic NFI support for the new arrivals and replenishment of basic NFI for vulnerable families will continue throughout 2019, for a total target of 206,400 people.106 These people will also be prioritized for winter support, including clothing for 105,000 children. The Cluster will continue advocating with the Government to replace 30,000 tents that have exceeded their lifespans in 20 camps,107 and provide timely and sufficient kerosene for heating/cooking, and air-water coolers during summer.••Out-of-camp response: IDPs living in a critical shelter108 coupled with socio-economic vulnerability compels SNFI partners to assist identified cases among IDPs, returnees and host community. Shelter needs of 230,000 people109 in 24 prioritized districts110 will be addressed through the provision of and support in installing Sealing-Off Kits (SOK); upgrades of unfinished, abandoned or other substandard buildings; and rental subsidies. In addition, substandard living conditions of 4,865 returnee families whose houses have been damaged during the war will be improved through basic repairs111 or provision of low-cost transitional shelter.112 This will provide for better living conditions, including improved insulation against harsh weather conditions. NFI support will be provided to 307,500 vulnerable IDPs, returnees and host communities. Winter NFI support will be provided to 150,000 highly vulnerable IDPs, including children clothing for 75,000 individuals.••Cash-based response: As markets and financial transfer services restart, the use of cash-based interventions to meet each specific household’s need in a more flexible manner is strongly encouraged. Having proven strong value in mobilizing small-scale, local contractors, cash for shelter programs piloted in 2018 will continue in 2019. Use of vouchers and other forms of conditional cash will be the preferred modality to cover NFI and winter needs. The Shelter Cluster will closely work with partners to identify barriers and find appropriate solutions to boost the use of this modality. ••Durable solutions: To contribute to durable solutions, the SNFI Cluster will take into account multi-sectoral needs of targeted population and ensure coordination with other relevant sectors such as Protection (including Housing, Land and Property Sub-Cluster), WASH, Livelihood and CCCM clusters and the Cash Working Group to provide an integrated/coordinated response when possible. Additionally, in light of the start of large reconstruction programmes led by stabilization actors, close collaboration around housing repairs continues to be necessary. Exit strategy••Advocate for an increased integration of humanitarian assistance into government support programmes by engaging with authorities such as MOMD to provide IDPs with the resources, such as replacement tents, provision of kerosene for cooking and heating, and compensation for those affected by the war.113••Coordinate with stabilization actors to ensure complementarity in war-damaged shelter repair programmes. ••Support capacity-building of the local government and civil societies to reinforce preparedness to respond to new emergencies.Accountability to Affected People••Tailor programmes based on beneficiaries’ feedback on community priority needs and ensure that shelter repairs and upgrades meet minimum Cluster standards. Accessibility114 for persons with special needs remains a concern.••Conduct community sensitization around beneficiary targeting mechanisms and scope of war-damaged shelter repairs to reduce potential social tensions and manage expectations in coordination with the CwC working group. ••Use existing complaints and reporting mechanisms, such as the IDP Call Centre, as well as other initiatives (“Call to Action, RTAP”, CwC Task Force and “Zero tolerance” policy against PSEA).••Remain engaged with the community through focus group discussions, post-distribution monitoring, and ad-hoc site visits. Protection risks and mitigation measures••There is the risk of generating tensions within the community between those who receive assistance, and those who do not. In some instances, due to perceived affiliation with extremist groups, partners have been requested not to assist certain families in need. Mitigation measures include the use of a clearly defined tool to identify socio-economic vulnerabilities115 combined with expert assessment of shelter needs, to avoid arbitrary/biased identification of beneficiaries, in parallel ensuring that communities are informed of the targeting and eligibility process. The SNFI Cluster will work with the Protection Cluster to advocate for marginalised and minority groups to be included in the SNFI assistance,116 whenever found eligible. The SNFI Cluster will also strengthen synergies with stabilization actors and raise awareness on potential protection related risks, advocating for war-damaged shelter repair programs to align to clearly-established technical and protection-oriented standards. ••Housing, land and property issues are closely interlinked with shelter interventions: forced evictions, land disputes, secondary occupation, tenure discrimination leading to inequitable assistance, and lack of proper documentation have been widely recorded in Iraq. Close consultation with and referral cases to HLP actors to address barriers in shelter assistance caused by housing, land and property issues will be crucial before commencing any shelter activity to not cause any harm.••The Shelter Cluster will also reinforce partners’ awareness on and response capacity to GBV related risks, especially when assessing needs of women and children. A work plan has been developed in 2018 and its concrete actions will be implemented, led by a GBV focal point appointed within the Cluster team. Main activities contemplate the use of GAM marker when reviewing project submissions, specific assessments on living conditions and their associated lack of dignity, privacy and safety, and the continuous collaboration with the RTAP initiative.Response strategy The CCCM Cluster partners will support 540,000 displaced people throughout the country by undertaking core CCCM activities. CCCM services in camps and informal sites117 are still needed to ensure the delivery of minimum standards of humanitarian assistance to IDPs. Most IDPs in camps and in informal sites are extremely vulnerable, especially female-headed-households, the elderly, the chronically ill, and persons with disabilities. If basic services and camp infrastructure are not maintained, vulnerable families in camps will not receive the assistance and services they need, resulting in heightened protection risks and possibly negative coping mechanisms. In addition, this will help ensure camps are capacitated to respond to emergency displacements and possible natural disasters. Advocacy, coordination, management, capacity development, and site risk reduction activities will be implemented in camps throughout the country, where 482,000 IDPs live. The Cluster will advocate and coordinate with relevant partners to ensure basic services are maintained and delivered in a timely manner. CCCM partners will increase their presence in informal sites across the country through mobile teams, targeting approximately 58,000 vulnerable IDPs who remain scattered, blended within the host community and in some areas may not be easily accessible due to security risks and long distances. Where there are such challenges, CRCs will be operationalized in priority areas as static structures. Partners will continue to work with the authorities to consolidate or close camps where it is feasible to do so in a responsible and principled manner through the Governorate Return Committees (GRCs). In light of potential closure of some camps in 2019, a strong CCCM presence will be required in such locations, particularly due to the potential involvement of armed security actors in relocation movements, and consequent risks to the safety and dignity of IDPs. The CCCM Cluster aims to minimize the dependency of IDPs on external aid through empowerment of the local authorities and local communities in and around camps and informal sites to actively engage in management, coordination and provision of required assistance to the IDPs. This transition strategy will be central to the responsible and staged approach of gradual handover of services to local governance structures. The capacity development of camp management teams, local authorities and community structures is a priority objective to be implemented through mentoring, training and coaching mechanisms. The CCCM Cluster will work towards empowering camp management actors, IDP communities, local authorities and host PEOPLE IN NEED0.9MCAMP COORDINATION AND CAMP MANAGEMENTAND CAMP MANAGEMENTPEOPLE TARGETED0.8MREQUIREMENTS (US$)34.5M# OF PARTNERS8CCCM OBJECTIVE 1:1Facilitate and coordinate the provision of multi-sectorial interventions and conduct site risk reduction activities to ensure a safe and dignified environment for internally displaced people in formal and informal sites, including for newly and secondary displaced.CCCM OBJECTIVE 22Empower the affected population and local actors to prepare, maintain, and coordinate CCCM activities.CCCM OBJECTIVE 33Facilitate sustainability of return and provide support to affected populations.BREAKDOWN OF PEOPLE IN NEED AND TARGETED BY STATUS, SEX AND AGE % Female BY STATUSBY SEX & AGE* % Children, adult, elderly PEOPLE IN NEEDPEOPLE TARGETEDFINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS# Internally displaced people# Highly vulnerable returnees# Host community $34.5M*Children (<18 years old), adult (18-59 years), elderly (>59 years)535349520.6M0.5M0.3M0.2M0.03M0.014M434344CONTACTMarguerite Nowak,nowak@unhcr.org communities to take responsibility in identifying and responding to the needs, with emphasis on the needs of persons of different age, gender and diversity as well as of individuals with specific needs. Despite the barriers for some IDPs to find a durable solution, the Cluster will advocate for IDPs to have freedom of movement, access to public services and livelihood opportunities. Moreover, CCCM activities in sites, such as infrastructure repairs and care and maintenance, will be implemented by residents through cash-for-work schemes. The CCCM Cluster, will contribute to sustainability of 210,000 returnees through the Community Resource Centres (CRCs) in four prioritized governorates (Anbar, Kirkuk, Ninewa and Salah al-Din), in collaboration with and within the existing Cluster structures. The centres provide an inter.governmental, humanitarian and recovery/stabilization platform at the community level. The CRCs support the government in establishing and reinforcing coordination and service delivery mechanisms to facilitate safe, voluntary, non.discriminatory and sustainable returns throughout Iraq.Operational plan••Identify gaps in service and assistance provision and collaborate with Clusters, their partners and authorities to cover these gaps in formal camps and informal sites. ••Train camp managers, sector partners, community focal points and local authorities on minimum standards of humanitarian assistance, and develop their capacity to use information systems to manage camps and informal sites.••Establish multi-sectorial referral pathways in camps and informal sites. ••Establish or support existing governance structures and complaint and feedback mechanisms in sites to ensure accountable participation.••Conduct surveys to understand the intentions of displaced populations and inform programming. ••Deploy mobile response teams to identify informal settlements and assess risks, needs and gaps.••Identify target locations for site risk reduction activities as well as undertaking care and maintenance activities in formal camps and informal sites.••Use cash-for-work schemes for implementing CCCM activities as well as implementing pilot projects that aim to improve self-reliance. ••Map relevant stakeholders for gradual handover of CCCM activities and service provision in formal camps. ••Establish 12 CRCs in high density return areas to support affected populations with appropriate linkages to humanitarian, transition / recovery and government actors.••Advocate for improved freedom of movement, access to public services, markets and livelihoods opportunities for IDPs in all sites.••Advocate with the government and development actors to address barriers to return through the GRCs.Exit strategy••Empower the affected-population and local actors to maintain and coordinate services and assistance in selected sites through a gradual handover to government bodies in a staged and responsible manner with the support of mobile CRC teams.••Provide capacity development activities, including training, mentoring, and coaching, to both camp-based and local government actors to enhance their involvement in camp management and coordination.••Liaise with recovery actors to encourage support to local authorities where municipal or directorate capacity is lacking.••Advocate for improved freedom of movement, access to public services, markets and livelihoods opportunities for IDPs, as well as addressing barriers to return.Accountability to Affected People••Ensure information is accessible and tailored to the needs of different groups through the CwC Task Force to ensure that their perceptions and intentions inform programming.

To mitigate this risk, the CCCM Cluster will work closely with protection actors to refer cases to the appropriate services and assistance through safe referral pathways. ••Mainstream protection, particularly prevention of gender-based violence, into activities through trainings, review of distribution systems, awareness on code of conduct, effective complaints and feedback mechanisms. To mitigate the risk of sexual exploitation and abuse, the Cluster will coordinate with the PSEA network to train relevant actors and raise awareness among the community.••The Cluster will work with the Protection Cluster to monitor incidents related to the presence of armed actors in camps. This will support higher-level advocacy to government to uphold the civilian and humanitarian character of camps.Response strategy The Education Cluster will support children to transition into recognized educational pathways. It will do this by changing its strategy from only securing access to learning spaces for conflict-affected children to strengthening the quality of both formal and non-formal learning opportunities for children in areas of displacement and return. Though progress has been made in the provision of formal schools in the camps, the cluster will work on improving the quality of teaching and learning in the camps to ensure children acquire literacy and numeracy which will help them to progress to the next levels. This is especially important in camps like Jeddah where gaps have been noted. In parallel, re-entering the formal schooling system may not be an option for children who have been out of school for more than three years. Given the large number of out-of-school adolescents and youth, non-formal education continues to be essential for this group. Closer collaboration with Directorates of Education (DoE) will be prioritized to restart education where it is not available in the eight118 governorates receiving returnees. Additionally, education partners will collaborate more closely with development actors as they will be responsible for the heavy infrastructural rehabilitation. In areas of return, strengthening community-run school structures such as PTAs and School Management Committees will be key, and partners will help train and equip these groups. In the return areas, the education cluster will work closely with the Mine Action sub-cluster to ensure the clearance of schools and well as the dissemination of mine risk education. Approximately 100,000 children are set to benefit from both mine risk education and safer school environments. The Education Cluster will also target approximately 28,286 vulnerable children in host communities, through the provision of learning materials and in some cases cash-based interventions to remove the economic barriers that prevent them from accessing education. The cluster will work with MoLSA and other relevant decentralized structures to ensure that vulnerable children who the cluster supports will be absorbed in the government social safety net. The Cluster will put Centrality of Protection at the center of its response by collaborating with relevant clusters. Specifically, the Education Cluster will collaborate with the Child Protection sub-cluster to ensure that the psychosocial needs of children, as identified in the 2019 Humanitarian Needs Overview, will be addressed through integrated protection and educational activities. Planned interventions will target approximately 86,960 children in the eight prioritized governorates. PEOPLE IN NEED2.6MEDUCATIONPEOPLE TARGETED0.5MREQUIREMENTS (US$)35.5M# OF PARTNERS20EDUCATION OBJECTIVE 1:1Increase access to quality formal and non-formal learning opportunities for children in areas of displacement and areas of return which allow for transition into recognized educational pathways.EDUCATION OBJECTIVE 22Schools and learning environments are protective and responsive to the needs of conflict affected children, youth and adolescents.EDUCATION OBJECTIVE 33Strengthen the capacity of the education system to plan and deliver a timely, appropriate and evidence-based education response.BREAKDOWN OF PEOPLE IN NEED AND TARGETED BY STATUS, SEX AND AGE % Female BY STATUSBY SEX & AGE* % Children, adult, elderly PEOPLE IN NEEDPEOPLE TARGETEDFINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS# Internally displaced people# Highly vulnerable returnees# Hostcommunity $35.5M*Children (<18 years old), adult (18-59 years), elderly (>59 years)10010049490.78M0.24M1.5M0.19M0.15M0.03M43CONTACTCleopatra Chipuriro,cchipuriro@unicef.orgAbdirisak Aden,Abdirisak.aden@savethechildren.orgThe Cluster will also work with the WASH Cluster to ensure that all 2,661 schools which scheduled for rehabilitation have adequate WASH services, to serve as a preparedness measure to avoid the spread of communicable diseases such as cholera and typhoid The Cluster will increase advocacy for the provision of government-paid and -trained teachers for IDPs both in and out of camps. Many IDP schools do not have adequate teaching staff to ensure quality education. Partners rely on volunteers who require financial incentives. Cluster partners are discussing with the Ministry of Education on a durable solution either regarding teacher re-distribution to cover gaps, or taking over the payment of incentives. A durable solution will take some time; therefore, partners need to find a way to continue to support the payment of incentives at least until the end of the current academic year (June 2019). The cluster therefore needs the support of education donors to ensure that there is a provision in place until such a time when government is able to fulfil its obligation.Operational planInternally displaced children in camps and in out-of-camp settings ••Advocate for the deployment and payment of qualified teachers by the Government of Iraq within the IDP camps as well as schools serving out-of-camp IDPs. ••Cover the financial incentives for volunteers for an agreed and specified time until the Government is able to take over.••Support teacher/ volunteer training initiatives on pedagogy to help improve learning outcomes.••Invest in pre-fabricated classrooms which can be moved to host community schools for additional space should the camps be consolidated.••Continue non-formal education for children and adolescence who are unable to enrol in formal schools.••Offer structured Psychosocial Support (PSS) activities within the schools with the support of Child Protection actors working through both teachers and school-based social workers.••Upgrade WASH facilities in camp and out-of-camp schools and implement hygiene promotion activities in schools.Children in return areasThe Directorates of Education (DoEs) have a strong role in supporting the reopening of schools.

Although advocacy has yielded some results as many DoEs and schools have allowed children without documentation to enrol, there are still gaps. The Cluster will continue to liaise with protection actors to ensure that as many children as possible get support to get the prerequisite documentation so that all conflict affected boys and girls access education.••Contamination of schools in areas of return by unexploded ordnances pose protection risk while the poor physical state of the schools can cause great distress to children. The Cluster will continue to engage with appropriate mine clearance actors to improve physical safety of learning spaces, and engage in light rehabilitation activities to improve physical appearance. Attacks on education will continue to be monitored and reported through the Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism on the six grave violations against children (MRM). ••Issues of gender-based violence, the sexual exploitation of children in schools and other learning spaces and corporal punishment in schools are major protection risk. The Cluster is advocating with all partners to ensure that schools have a code of conduct and that all who come into contact with children are trained in child safeguarding. The Cluster is going to continually train all partners on gender mainstreaming, GBV and PSEA. Trainings in positive disciplinary techniques will also help teachers with alternatives to corporal punishment.Response strategy An estimated 2.38 million individuals are need of livelihoods support. The figure represents 37 per cent of the total number of 6.7 million people in need of some form of humanitarian assistance. The increase of people in need of livelihoods from 2.1 million in 2018 to 2.38 million in 2019 may be attributed to the increased number of returnees in 2018. The Cluster will continue to focus on where needs are highest in particular, supporting returnees to avoid instances of secondary displacement from a lack of job opportunities in areas of origin. Creating sustainable returns is paramount to achieving expected humanitarian outcomes.Several IDP camps are expected to close in the coming months. Some cluster partners will target some of these camps with asset replacement interventions, which would help IDPs in case they choose to return to their areas of origin.The Cluster’s intervention will focus on small grants and in-kind support for asset replacement, and financial literacy information sharing to strengthen the transition from assisted aid to resilience to avoid secondary displacement. Asset Replacement micro grants and in-kind support for recovery of lost productive livelihood assets will be provided to help people in need to re-establish a livelihood, to increase their income, and restore their economic self-sufficiency. Asset replacement interventions can also support stimulating markets in areas with high numbers of returnees, since rehabilitated small businesses and micro enterprises ensure that more goods and services are available. As the recovery progresses, these rehabilitated enterprises may eventually create more jobs to further support livelihoods in the area. Selection of beneficiaries will continue to adopt the Cluster policy of conflict sensitivity and “Do No Harm.” The Emergency Livelihoods Cluster relies on its partners’ capacity in target areas, where they have established credibility on the ground during previous cycles of displacement and return. Linkages and complementarity with MPCA and Food Security Cluster:••FSC targets productive assets mainly in agricultural areas, while EL targets urban areas with provision of temporary jobs or provisions of assets needed for job generation.••All ELC partners for 2019 have established work and professional relationships in their targeted communities, based on previous interventions, either in emergency livelihoods or in other sector.PEOPLE IN NEED2.4MEMERGENCY LIVELIHOODSPEOPLE TARGETED0.7MREQUIREMENTS (US$)9.3M# OF PARTNERS9EMERGENCY LIVELIHOODS OBJECTIVE 1:1Provide immediate access to income to highly vulnerable conflict affected populations; IDPs, returnees and host communities to assist and facilitate safe returns and resettlement, and strengthen resilience.BREAKDOWN OF PEOPLE IN NEED AND TARGETED BY STATUS, SEX AND AGE % Female BY STATUSBY SEX & AGE* % Children, adult, elderly PEOPLE IN NEEDPEOPLE TARGETEDFINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS# Internally displaced people# Highly vulnerable returnees# Host community 47489852$9.3M49400.4M0.005M0.09M0.02M0.1M-*Children (<18 years), adult (18-59 years), elderly (>59 years)CONTACTGozde Avci Legrand,gozde.avci@undp.orgAyman Ramsis,a.ramsis@zoa.ngo••Inter-sector interventions may take one or more of many possibilities as follows (a) referral of beneficiaries in coordination with Protection Cluster and GBV, Child Protection, or HLP sub-clusters; (b) coordinated geo-targeting and/or vulnerability based coordination and referral with the Food Security Cluster, and Cash Working Group; (c) intra-organization coordination between different sectors to deepen impact, such as protection and emergency livelihoods.Operational plan••Market and labour assessments with gender sensitivity will be conducted to advise on which types of small and micro enterprises should be supported with asset replacement grants and in-kind support.

The needs of returnees and IDPs are transitioning from emergency to protracted socio-economic needs, which appear to increase in severity in the months following return and displacement.119 Moreover, 31 per cent of households have a predicted per capita monthly consumption below the poverty line (92,000 IQD/monthly).120 MPCA supports the consumption for basic needs of vulnerable households, while aiming to decrease the likelihood of resorting to negative coping strategies, including secondary displacement triggered by financial imperatives. At the same time, MPCA, as a cash transfer programme, implemented mostly through mobile money transfer and cash in hand (Hawalas), remains a cost-efficient and flexible intervention to respond to sudden shocks, such as natural or manmade hazards. The MPCA sector has reinforced its coordination with stakeholders providing MPCA outside of the HRP to maximise geographical coverage and avoid duplications.In 2019, the provision of MPCA will be prioritized for vulnerable households based on their socio-economic vulnerability defined as predicted consumption and not based on their status. For this purpose, new regional scoring models121 were developed by the Cash Working Group (CWG) in collaboration with the World Bank, reinforcing the complementary between the MPCA and Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs’ (MoLSA) vulnerability models. This enhanced complementarity will facilitate a transition to durable solutions by allowing the identification of MPCA beneficiaries who are likely eligible for the Cash Transfer Social Protection Programme implemented by MoLSA. This model will also allow a determination of the eligibility for MPCA based on predicted monthly consumption rather than vulnerabilities deriving strictly from displacement patterns. By strengthening the consumption capacity of vulnerable families, MPCA will play an essential role to support the (re)integration and transition to durable solutions for out-of-camp and protracted IDPs and returnees. The adoption of scoring models and the diversification in terms of number of cash transfers will facilitate a more granular response that recognises the varied socio-economic needs of families who live below the poverty line across the three different regions of Iraq. PEOPLE IN NEED2.9MMULTI-PURPOSE CASH ASSISTANCEPEOPLE TARGETED0.7MREQUIREMENTS (US$)115M# OF PARTNERS9MULTI PURPOSE CASH ASSISTANCE OBJECTIVE 1:1Provide multi-purpose cash assistance to vulnerable households affected by conflict and to extremely vulnerable households affected by a shock generating humanitarian needs that cannot be covered by existing national services.MULTI PURPOSE CASH ASSISTANCE OBJECTIVE 2:2Facilitate vulnerable households’ access to complementary and critical humanitarian and national services, including non-contributory social protection programmes.BREAKDOWN OF PEOPLE IN NEED AND TARGETED BY STATUS, SEX AND AGE % Female BY STATUSBY SEX & AGE* % Children, adult, elderlyPEOPLE IN NEEDPEOPLE TARGETEDFINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS# Internally displaced people# Highly vulnerable returnees# host community$114.8M*Children (<18 years old), adult (18-59 years), elderly (>59 years)484841410.7M0.38M2.0M0.32M0.2M0.04M494933CONTACTMauro Clerici,clericim@unhcr.orgVacantThe MPCA sector will works towards strengthening referral systems and accountability to affected people. Incorporated into the new tool are mechanisms to enhance the capacity of MPCA partners to identifying needs for referral to other critical humanitarian services. Based on the needs identified both at household and at neighbourhood/village level, the CWG may advocate with other sectors for a multi-sectoral response. The MPCA sector will maintain the capacity of responding to sudden events. It will make provisions to provide MPCA to support the immediate basic needs of extremely vulnerable households within two months from the event. The CWG can target up to approximately 40,000 individuals who might be affected by a sudden event in 2019.Operational planTo achieve it’s strategy, the Cluster will••Implement cash-only activities for basic needs in all the 35-prioritized location and in 16 other locations where needs have been identified and MPCA partners have capacity to respond. ••Target the bottom 30 per cent of the population who do not have to capacity to cover their basic needs. Numbers of MPCA instalments are based on how much the predicted consumption differs from the poverty marker which indicates the capacity of households to cover their basic needs, which are calculated based on the Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket (SMEB).122 TThe MPCA sector estimates that some 44.4 per cent of households will be assessed as vulnerable (eligible for one month of MPCA); 31.8 per cent as moderately vulnerable (eligible for two months of MPCA); and 23.4 per cent as extremely vulnerable (eligible for three months of MPCA). The scoring model will be also applied to respond to the socio-economic needs of households affected by sudden events (natural or manmade disasters). In the event of an unexpected event, MPCA partners commit to provide a response as soon as possible and no longer than two months after the event. ••Conduct market assessments and price monitoring before the implementation of MPCA programmes. Additionally, verification exercises and post-distribution monitoring will be part of the response to ensure the quality of the assessment and an analysis on the impact of MPCA transfers. ••Use the scoring model and assessment tool to support the inter-agency response by allowing the identification of needs for referral to critical humanitarian services at household and neighbourhood/village level. When and where feasible, MPCA partners will adopt integrated programming, specifically with Protection Cluster (connection to legal services to retrieve necessary documents to access social safety nets), Emergency Livelihood Cluster (graduation model123) and Food Security Cluster (integration with Cash for Work Programmes). Adherence with 2019 prioritized areas will further support the coordination with other sectors and a more holistic response to the identified needs.Exit strategy••Quantify and map the needs of households for inclusion in the MoLSA social safety net and coordinate with MoLSA to develop evidence-based advocacy for the expansion of social protection programmes and the development of predictable financial requirements. This exercise will also facilitate the analysis on the MoLSA staffing/assessment gaps and assess MoLSA’s ability to respond to unexpected events.••Advocate within the Social Protection Forum124 for a holistic and inclusive approach to social protection aiming, to achieve necessary complementarities with other sectoral social protection interventions (case management, livelihood, education, health).Accountability to Affected People••Improve monitoring and tracking of incidents of interference from local authorities through a monthly-produced matrix to advocate against practices such as attempted fraud, disruption of activities in relation to persons with perceived affiliation.••Establish and/or strengthen complaints response mechanisms inside partner organizations, including hotlines, feedback boxes and info desks at distribution points enabling feedback from beneficiaries.••Respond to critical needs identified through RPAs and RNAs and address recommendations from these assessments. Protection risks analysis and mitigation measures••Provision of assistance would de facto sanction an unprincipled approach to returns. MPCA partners will assist on a case-by-case basis, measuring the benefits and risks that provision of MPCA would have on the affected population.••The increasing use of cash interventions exposes people to risks of abuse of power and fraud perpetrated by financial service providers, traders or money agents. The Cluster will use existing complaints and feedback mechanisms, information from the IDP Call Centre to ensure that allegations of fraud and abuse of power are timely verified and addressed. ••The scale of MPCA programmes generates risks associated with interference by civil and military authorities and/or community leaders. This may also result in blocking access of partners to specific population groups. MPCA partners have been trained on the importance of not sharing beneficiaries’ lists and the CWG has established an interference tracking tool to develop evidence-based advocacy with authorities, where necessary. ••The MPCA sector has estimated that approximately 30 per cent of the MPCA beneficiaries will be female-headed households. The scoring model adopted by the CWG takes specific emergency coping strategies (including survival sex and forced marriage) into consideration for determining the consumption capacity of households and their eligibility for MPCA. Additionally, as part of the Real Time Accountability Partnership on Gender-based Violence in Emergencies (RTAP), the MPCA sector will appoint a GBV focal point to facilitate GBV and PSEA related workstreams (especially capacity-building of MPCA partners and mainstreaming of GBV and PSEA in tools and SOPs). Response strategyIn 2019, the humanitarian community in Iraq will prioritize contingency planning for any emergency that may occur. The HCT has agreed an overarching strategic objective in relation to improving humanitarian response timeliness and capacity through preparedness-related interventions. To contribute to this objective, the Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) Consortium intends to enhance capacity of existing government structures and local authorities including the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Cell (JCMC), the Joint Crisis Coordination Centre (JCC), the Board of Relief and Humanitarian Affairs (BRHA) in Dahuk, the Ministry of Displacement and Migration (MODM) and Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (MoLSA). This exercise will enable them to better cope with future emergencies and taking over the responsibility for and operation of the RRM.Operational plan••The RRM consortium will transfer the necessary knowledge related to RRM concepts, lessons learned, best practices and operational modalities through several workshops and trainings, and strengthen government’s capacity to cope with future emergencies. ••To facilitate the hand-over process, the consortium will undertake a feasibility study, including a risk analysis and capacity assessment, which will ascertain the feasibility of the handover, identify the relevant counterpart(s) and will guide the overall transition processes. ••The RRM consortium will undertake assessments of essential resources and identify possible government capacity gaps in the areas of contingency planning, emergency preparedness and response, operational planning, prepositioning and warehousing, monitoring and reporting and knowledge management. This will provide a baseline for the capacity development response that the consortium will undertake.••During the transition period, the consortium will assist people in need of RRM assistance through government counterparts and will provide logistical and technical support to the government until the handover is completed.Exit strategy••Finalise partners’ exit from Iraq, and transfer the RRM mechanism to the GoI. The Consortium will strengthen the capacity of existing government structures and local authorities to enable them to better cope with future emergencies.Accountability to Affected People••Involve beneficiaries at the ‘post distribution’ stage through monitoring and feedback mechanisms including help desks set up to collect complaints and feedback and to ensure that good practices are adopted by the government counterparts. Protection risks and mitigation measures••The Consortium will ensure that all deliveries made through government counterparts during the transition period are aligned with protection principles and minimum standards by ensuring that relevant capacities are transferred to the government counterpartsRAPID RESPONSE MECHANISMORGANIZATIONS TARGETED5REQUIREMENTS (US$)0.9M# OF PARTNERS3RRM OBJECTIVE 1:1Enhance rapid response capacity of government actors and local authorities to cope with future emergencies, by equipping stakeholders with tools and knowledge to apply emergency concepts and best practices.CONTACTAtheer Al Yaseen,aalyaseen@unicef.orgLionel Laforgue,aforgue@unfpa.orgSalar Khudadad,salar.khudadad@wfp.orgResponse strategyThe Emergency Telecommmunication Cluster (ETC) has planned to phase out by 31 March 2019, recognizing the shift in humanitarian response in Iraq from emergency frontline assistance to addressing protracted displacement as well as recovery, resilience and development-peace nexus activities. During the first quarter of 2019, the ETC will be ending internet connectivity services in As Salamiyah, Haj Ali and Hassan Sham IDP camps. For these camps, there is availability of services from local providers that humanitarian actors can contract directly. The Cluster will complete outstanding projects for which commitments have been made to the humanitarian community (such as handover support and maintenance of security communications network) to either the United Nations Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS) or lead agency to be agreed by Iraq ICT Working Group.Operational plan••Disband internet connectivity, IT and power supply equipment installed in As Salamiyah, Haj Ali and Hassan Sham IDP camps.

Since its activation in March 2014, the Logistics Cluster operation has been shaped based on the needs identified by the humanitarian community, and activities implemented in the five main areas of coordination, information management, logistics services provision, capacity-building and advocacy (with a focus on access challenges at customs points). As of January 2018, the IASC L 3 response designation was deactivated. This mirrored a change in the humanitarian context in Iraq. Demand for common logistics services has gradually decreased due to the end of active conflict, improved access and market functionality. Furthermore, market assessments clearly indicate that local private logistics sector options are available and accessible to the humanitarian community, without a risk for competition over scarce assets. Consequently, mainstreamed logistics services offered by the Logistics Cluster on a no-cost-to-user basis (such as warehousing) will no longer be required. It was agreed that Logistics Services will be discontinued in 2019, after discussions with partner organisations and based on a consensus-oriented approach. The remaining limited coordination and information management functions will be handed over to a national NGO, with the support of an international NGO by March 2019. The Global Logistics Cluster, in coordination with WFP Country Office in Iraq, will continue to monitor the situation and support the working group while remaining on stand-by to immediately deploy staff and scale up logistics emergency capacity should the needs ariseIn 2019, the Logistics Cluster in Iraq will focus its support to partners through building capacity of, and gradually handing over responsibilities to local partners and relevant authorities, as per discussions with approximately 31 partners active in Iraq in 2018 and based on a consensus-oriented approach. In the framework of localizing emergency response and empowerment of national actors, and in line with Grand Bargain commitments, the Logistics Cluster is transitioning into a sectoral working group led by a national NGO and co-led by an international NGO. Operational planTransition activities to a sector group••Hold regular coordination meetings in Baghdad, Erbil, Dahuk and ad-hoc field locations as required, to address potential logistics constraints and bottlenecks. ••Share information on changes in government processes, and updated sector-relevant information through dedicated platforms such as the Logistics Cluster Iraq country website and web-based group and mailing list.

While CCS has a number of partners, the IDP Call Centre (IIC) managed by UNOPS, is the only CCS project working directly with people in need (to facilitate–through referrals–the provision of relief. IIC targets 100 per cent of potentially impacted people through a multi-channel, multi-media countrywide outreach campaign. The CCS will work to enable principled, effective and inclusive country-wide strategic and operational coordination among humanitarian actors and relevant stakeholders in line with the Centrality of Protection. CCS will continue to provide and support evidence-based humanitarian action at national, regional, governorate and local levels, while support to the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT), Inter-Cluster Coordination Group (ICCG) and other bodies’ remains a priority, in addition to strengthening cluster and NGO capacity for deeper field coordination. Humanitarian access facilitation and advocacy will be supported through civil-military coordination efforts, reinforced coordination structures and real-time information sharing, seeking to enable a safe response delivery in complex, insecure and volatile operational environments. Prompt mobilization of life-saving response will be facilitated through timely dissemination of multi-platform communication materials based on reliable information, coordinated and streamlined multi-sectoral assessments, and comprehensive and impartial analysis of humanitarian needs and issues. CCS will ensure principled approach in all its activities. Transparency and accountability will be strengthened through two-way communication between affected populations and humanitarian actors across all levels of response, including confidential feedback and referral.Operational plan••Support the HCT and ICCG at national level, to ensure that strategic and operational decision-making are well informed.

Between January and December 2018, 170 partners reached 2.9 million people out of the 3.4 million targeted (85 per cent) with humanitarian assistance, including 1.3 million children and 1.4 million women and girls. In the year ahead, if we fail to respond to the needs of the displaced families, returnees and host communities, we risk sacrificing all the gains made to date, and pushing vulnerable Iraqis back to undignified and unsafe living conditions, and impeding their transition to normal life. WHAT IF?...WE FAIL TO RESPONDIDPS AND RETURNEES REQUIRE PROTECTION ASSISTANCE TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE RETURNS Persistent protection concerns may negatively impact the ability of IDPs to return to their areas of origin and rebuild their lives. Lack of sufficient protection services could force people to adapt negative coping mechanisms. Humanitarian programming is necessary to mitigate the concerns and bolster the ability of displaced persons and returnees to resume daily activities and a dignified existence.VULNERABLE FAMILIES WILL BE EXPOSED TO HAZARDS SLOWING THEIRTRANSITION INTO NORMAL LIFEIraq is prone to earthquakes, floods, droughts and disease outbreaks. Natural disasters threaten to disproportionately affect the people who are already vulnerable as a result of the sustained years of conflict and hence hamper the country’s transition to recovery. Adequate preparedness and timely response to new emergencies will minimise the impact of disasters on the lives of at risk people.HIGHLY VULNERABLE WILL NOT ACHIEVE DURABLE SOLUTIONSPeople in protracted displacement, host communities, and returnees will continue to require access to basic services, enhanced livelihood opportunities and sectoral assistance to underpin their resilience. These people will continue to require targeted and sustained assistance from the humanitarian community to achieve durable solutions as Iraq continues to rebuild after many years of conflict.SOCIAL SECTORS SUCH AS HEALTH, WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE, EDUCATION AND HOUSING REMAIN OVERSTRETCHEDDue to damage to infrastructure and the delayed implementation of recovery and resilience activities, affected families will not have sufficient access to public services. Inadequate housing, lack of sustained access to safe water and sanitation and hygiene services, insufficient access to education will negatively affect vulnerable population. Without support from humanitarian community in 2019, vulnerable Iraqis will be unable to fully transition to a prosperous, stable, post-conflict society in the years ahead.GUIDE TO GIVINGHRPDONATING THROUGH THE COUNTRY HUMANITARIAN FUNDThe Iraq Humanitarian Fund is a country-based pooled fund: a multi-donor humanitarian financing instruments established by the Emergency Relief Coordinator and managed by OCHA at the country level under the leadership of the Humanitarian Coordinator. Find out more about the pooled fund by visiting the website: www.unocha.org/iraqCONTRIBUTING TO THE HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE PLANTo see the Iraq Humanitarian Needs Overview, Humanitarian Response Plan and monitoring reports, and donate directly to organizations participating to the plan, please visit :www.humanitarianresponse.info/operations/iraqDONATING THROUGH THE CENTRAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE FUND (CERF)CERF provides rapid initial funding for life-saving actions at the onset of emergencies and for poorly funded, essential humanitarian operations in protracted crises. The OCHA-managed CERF receives contributions from various donors – mainly governments, but also private companies, foundations, charities and individuals – which are combined into a single fund. This is used for crises anywhere in the world. Find out more about the CERF and how to donate by visiting the CERF website: www.unocha.org/cerf/donateIN-KIND RELIEF AIDThe United Nations urges donors to make cash rather than in-kind donations, for maximum speed and flexibility, and to ensure the aid materials that are most needed are the ones delivered. If you can make only in-kind contributions in response to disasters and emergencies, please contact:logik@un.orgREGISTERING AND RECOGNIZING YOUR CONTRIBUTIONSOCHA manages the Financial Tracking Service (FTS), which records all reported humanitarian contributions (cash, in-kind, multilateral and bilateral) to emergencies. Its purpose is to give credit and visibility to donors for their generosity and to show the total amount of funding and expose gaps in humanitarian plans. Please report yours to FTS, either by email to fts@un.org or through the online contribution report form at http://fts.unocha.orgThis document is produced on behalf of the Humanitarian Country Team and partners.This document provides the Humanitarian Country Team’s shared understanding of the crisis, including the most pressing humanitarian needs, and reflects its joint humanitarian response planning.The designation employed and the presentation of material on this report do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the Humanitarian Country Team and partners concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.www.unocha.org/iraqwww.humanitarianresponse.info/en/operations/iraq@OCHAIraq
