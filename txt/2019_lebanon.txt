Terminology in the Lebanon Crisis Response Plan (LCRP) 
The UN characterizes the flight of civilians from Syria as a refugee movement, and considers that these Syrians are 
seeking international protection and are likely to meet the refugee definition. 
The Government of Lebanon considers that it is being subject to a situation of mass influx. It refers to individuals who 
fled from Syria into its territory after March 2011 as temporarily displaced individuals, and reserves its sovereign right 
to determine their status according to Lebanese laws and regulations. 
The Lebanon Crisis Response Plan uses the following terminologies to refer to persons who have fled from and cannot 
return to their country of origin: 
1. “persons displaced from Syria” (which can, depending on context, include Palestinian refugees from Syria as well 
as registered and unregistered Syrian nationals); 
2. “displaced Syrians” (referring to Syrian nationals, including those born in Lebanon to displaced Syrian parents); 
3. “persons registered as refugees by UNHCR” and; 
4. Palestinian refugees from Lebanon, refer to 180,000 PRL living in 12 camps and 156 gatherings. 
5. Palestinian refugees from Syria, refer to 28,800 PRS across Lebanon.

CORE PRINCIPLES AND COMMITMENTS 
Building on the lessons learned from previous LCRP frameworks, as well as a needs and results-based approach used for 
defining outputs, targets and related budgets, key priorities for improving delivery of the LCRP include: 
• Strengthening current tracking, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms; 
• Improving transparency, efficiency and accountability; 
• Reinforcing Government institutions’ leadership and partnership with UN organizations, the donor community, 
international and national non-governmental organizations and other civil society actors; 
• Enhancing the programmatic design and implementation systems in view of the broadened focus on 
stabilization and targeting the most vulnerable; and 
• Improving field level coordination in light of the multi-year programming envisioned for 2017-2020. 
As a basis for addressing these priorities, several core principles and commitments have been agreed between GoL and its 
international partners: see section 4.6, ‘Principles of partnership and accountability’.

FOREWORD 
Pierre Bou Assi 
Minister of Social Affairs 
Philippe Lazzarini 
UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator 
2019 will mark eight years since the conflict in Syria began, and serves as a reminder of Lebanon’s unwavering 
support and generosity to Syria’s displaced despite the wide-ranging impact of the Syrian conflict on 
its economy and society. With some 1.5 million Syrians in addition to a large community of Palestinian 
refugees, Lebanon continues to host the highest number of displaced per capita in the world, showing the 
tremendous commitment to displaced Syrians and vulnerable populations within its borders. 
Since 2011, Lebanon has received more than US$6.7 billion in support of its crisis response, with tangible 
results on the ground. In 2018, the response through the Lebanon Crisis Response Plan (LCRP) prevented 
a further deterioration in food insecurity and poverty levels for the most vulnerable communities, while 
supporting municipalities and infrastructure across the country. With increased investments in public 
services and local institutions, response partners are stepping up their support to Lebanon to help it cope 
with the crisis. These achievements are a testament to the strong partnerships that have evolved under the 
LCRP, led by the Government of Lebanon in collaboration with the UN and more than 150 international and 
national partners. 
While we have achieved key successes over the past year, the situation of many vulnerable families remains 
extremely precarious, and it is more important than ever that we maintain our support. Amid economic 
uncertainty and an extremely protracted crisis, challenges continue to deepen for many displaced and 
vulnerable Lebanese who face long-term poverty and deteriorating dwelling conditions. Lack of legal 
residency remains a crucial issue for many displaced families, compounding their vulnerability. These areas 
will be further prioritized in 2019. While it is difficult to predict how the situation will evolve, it is critical that 
we maintain strong and predictable support to the most vulnerable families, to avoid tensions and maintain 
stability. While a number of returns are taking place, they will increase gradually once the main obstacles 
to return are addressed in Syria. Until such time, Lebanon will continue to require substantial support and 
attention to mitigate the impact of the crisis. 
It is vital that we remain mobilized and redouble our efforts. The 2019 LCRP calls for $2.6 billion for the 
provision of direct humanitarian assistance and protection to 2.4 million highly vulnerable people. The 
appeal will also ensure the provision of basic services to 2.16 million affected persons, while supporting 
public institutions and the country’s overall stability. In line with the commitments made at the London 
and Brussels conferences, the LCRP seeks to expand investments and partnerships to ensure recovery while 
working towards long-term development strategies until durable solutions become available on a larger 
scale in Syria. This year will also provide partners with the unique opportunity to take stock of achievements 
so far through the mid-term review of the LCRP, and help us set course for the remainder of the 2017-2020 
framework. 
As we embark on the penultimate year of the LCRP, our collective solidarity with vulnerable Lebanese and 
displaced communities must continue. It is difficult to predict what the future holds, but we all share the 
same ambitions for what we can collectively achieve for Lebanon. 2019 offers an important opportunity for 
us to accelerate our progress towards stability and greater prospects for all, leaving no one behind.

Context and key challenges 
Eight years into the Syrian crisis, Lebanon remains at 
the forefront of one of the worst humanitarian crises of 
our time and has shown exceptional commitment and 
solidarity to people displaced by the conflict in Syria. 
As of October 2018, the Government of Lebanon (GoL) 
estimates that the country hosts 1.5 million Syrians 
who have fled the conflict in Syria (including 950,3341 
registered as refugees with UNHCR, of which 25.2% are 
women, 19.4% men, 27.1% are girls, 28.3% are boys with 
diverse backgrounds and specific needs), along with 
28,800 Palestinian refugees from Syria (PRS) and a preexisting 
population of an estimated 180,000 Palestinian 
refugees from Lebanon (PRL) living in 12 camps and 156 
gatherings.2 The vulnerabilities of each of these groups 
have different root causes, requiring the overall response 
strategy to include a multifaceted range of interventions, 
from emergency aid to development assistance. Nearly 
half of the Lebanese, Syrian and Palestinian populations 
affected by the crisis are children and adolescents.3 Up 
to 1.4 million children under 18 years of age are currently 
growing up at risk, deprived, and with acute needs 
for basic services and protection.4 Public services are 
overstretched, with demand exceeding the capacity of 
institutions and infrastructure to meet needs. 
The conflict in Syria has significantly impacted Lebanon’s 
social and economic growth, caused deepening poverty 
and humanitarian needs, and exacerbated pre-existing 
development constraints in the country. Moreover, at the 
end of 2015, the crisis had cost the Lebanese economy 
an estimated US$18.15 billion due to the economic 
slowdown, loss in fiscal revenues and additional pressure 
on public services.5 
Unemployment and high levels of informal labour were 
already a serious problem pre-crisis, with the World Bank 
suggesting that the Lebanese economy would need to 
create six times as many jobs just to absorb the regular 
market entrants.6i Unemployment7 is particularly high 
(1) As at 30 November 2018. 
(2) For further details on the Palestinian figures, see the official Census carried out by Central 
Administration of Statistics, the Palestinian Bureau of Statistics and the Lebanese Palestinian 
Dialogue Committee in July 2017. 
(3) UNHCR and UNRWA statistics. 
(4) The response within the LCRP will be in line with the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child. 
(5) According to the World Bank, the cumulative cost to Lebanon since the start of the 
conflict, in terms of lowering the GDP growth rate, is US$18.15 billion through 2015, and the 
fiscal impact, in terms of lower revenues, is estimated at $4.2 billion during 2012-2015. See: 
World Bank (2017), Preliminary findings of the Economic and Social Impact Assessment of 
the Syrian Conflict on Lebanon. Public debt currently stands at $83.69 billion (LBP 126,165 
billion) for August 2018. Gross public debt reached 149 per cent of GDP in 2017. Source: 
Ministry of Finance. Please note that the current account deficit reached 20 per cent of GDP 
as a result of the economic situation and not solely due to the crisis. 
(6) The informality rate was estimated at 50 per cent by the World Bank. 
(7) The Government stated, in its Vision for Stabilisation and Development presented at the 
Brussels conference in April 2017: “The World Bank estimates that as a result of the Syria 
crisis some 200,000 Lebanese have been pushed into poverty (adding to the 1 million before 
the crisis) and that some 250,000-300,000 have become unemployed, in particular youth.” 
Additionally, unemployment among Palestinian refugees stands at 52.2 per cent according 
to the AUB Survey on the Social Economic Status of Palestine refugees in Lebanon 2015. 
INTRODUCTION 
in some of the country’s poorest localities: in some 
areas, it is nearly double the national average, placing 
considerable strain on host communities.8ii Both 
Lebanese and displaced Syrians perceive that longstanding 
inequalities are deepening, and competition for 
jobs and access to resources and services remain drivers 
of tension at the local level. The economic downturn has 
had a disproportionate effect on young people entering 
the workforce: Lebanon’s youth unemployment rate is 37 
per cent, compared with a 25 per cent national average.iii 
Relations between displaced Syrians and host 
communities are relatively stable, with no major incidents 
of intercommunal violence. Municipal measures have 
been imposed in some municipalities, making host 
community-displaced community interactions more 
challenging.iv At the community level, displaced Syrians 
and Lebanese are also interacting less often – especially 
in social circles where daily and regular interactions are 
down 10 per cent from May 2017 to June 2018.v 
The assistance made possible by donor contributions 
and implemented by humanitarian and development 
partners under the Lebanon Crisis Response Plan (LCRP), 
along with the exceptional hospitality of Lebanese 
communities, has brought substantial, vitally-needed 
support across all sectors and has prevented an even 
greater deterioration of living conditions for the poorest 
groups. Since 2013, a total of $6.39 billion has been 
received in support of the crisis response, including $4.5 
billion under the current 2017-2020 LCRP.9 Achievements 
under the LCRP and through the government include: 
support to Lebanese infrastructure such as roads, water 
and waste management; a wide range of initiatives 
helping local municipalities implement priority projects 
for their communities; extensive cash assistance bringing 
life-saving support to the poorest groups while boosting 
the local economy; support to health centres and 
hospitals around the country; a better understanding 
of affected populations’ views and priorities to inform 
sector interventions; and substantial advances in helping 
the Government of Lebanon enrol greater numbers 
of children in public schools every year. However, 
despite these achievements, the needs are growing and 
continue to outstrip resources, and renewed support is 
essential. The prolonged crisis is having an ever-stronger 
impact on Syrian, Palestinian and vulnerable Lebanese 
households, as well as on Lebanese host populations 
and the country’s institutions and infrastructure. 
The LCRP, a joint plan between the Government of 
Lebanon and its international and national partners, 
aims to respond to these challenges in a holistic, 
comprehensive manner through longer-term, multi-year 
(8) In Wadi Khaled, unemployment is estimated to be 58 per cent.

September 2018.

LEBANON CRISIS RESPONSE PLAN 2017-2020 PART I : Introduction . 
planning to achieve the following strategic objectives: 
ensure the protection of displaced Syrians, vulnerable 
Lebanese and Palestinian refugees; provide immediate 
assistance to vulnerable populations; support service 
provision through national systems; and reinforce 
Lebanon’s economic, social and environmental stability. 
To achieve these strategic objectives, the LCRP is 
committed to respond to the needs identified by the 
affected communities, government and its partners, 
and to strengthen communication and transparency 
by ensuring information from response actors is 
accessible and uses appropriate channels. It seeks to 
set out an integrated response centred on needs which 
recognizes the interrelatedness and beneficial impact of 
the activities undertaken in the various sectors on the 
individual’s protection and dignity. It is critical that the 
response maintains a strong focus on ensuring access to 
humanitarian assistance to all vulnerable communities 
and continued protection in Lebanon. In line with 
the commitments made at the London, and Brussels 
conferences, the response strongly and continuously 
seeks to expand investments, partnerships and delivery 
models that ensure recovery, and social stability whilst 
working towards longer-term development strategies 
and durable solutions. In Lebanon, the main durable 
solution for displaced Syrians is their safe, dignified 
and non-coercive return to their country of origin, in 
accordance with international law and the principle 
of non-refoulement. Another durable solution is the 
resettlement of those displaced from Syria to a third 
country. The international partners recognize that the 
stay of displaced people in Lebanon is temporary, and 
commit to continue to provide support to both host 
community and the displaced Syrians.vi 
The LCRP also aims to increase the focus on aid 
coordination under the general leadership, guidance 
and supervision of the Government of Lebanon, 
through the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA) which 
hasthe legal mandate to oversee the response to 
the crisis, in partnership with the donor community, 
UN agencies, civil society actors including NGOs, the 
private sector, and academic institutions. In addition, 
the LCRP strives to promote transparency, enhanced 
coordination, tracking, accountability, efficiency and 
learning, through reinforced and objective monitoring 
and evaluation. As a medium-term plan, the LCRP aims 
to address national objectives and priorities to respond 
to the impact of the Syrian crisis in Lebanon through 
an overarching four-year strategic planning framework 
developed and implemented under the leadership 
of MoSA in collaboration with the UN, national and 
international NGOs, other civil society actors and the 
donor community. 
It is essential for the international community to 
strengthen its international cooperation with, and 
development support to, Lebanon to respond to the 
protracted displacement from Syria. This is in line with 
the shared responsibility of the international community 
to manage large movements of refugees that was 
acknowledged by all states in the 2016 New York 
Declaration for Refugees and Migrants of September 
2016vii and its Comprehensive Refugee Response 
Framework (CRRF), as well as in Lebanon’s Statement of 
Intent presented at the 2016 London Conferenceviii and 
“A Vision for Stabilization and Development in Lebanon”ix 
presented at the Brussels Conferences in 2017 and 2018 
respectively. One of the LCRP partners’ key priorities 
in Lebanon is helping to mobilize increased financial 
resources to support the country’s national institutions 
and strengthen public service delivery systems, as a 
critical way to meet growing needs, mitigate a further 
deterioration of the situation, and preserve social 
stability 
The LCRP is founded on needs-based, bottom-up 
and cross-sectoral approaches and, as such, requires 
adaptation as changes in experiences and context occur. 
Yearly appeals are developed based on an annual review 
of needs. Each document includes detailed targets 
and budgets for the current year, along with indicative 
figures for the following year where feasible. The 
current document therefore outlines the updated sector 
response plans for 2019, based on results achieved within 
the LCRP in 2017 and 2018, and an analysis of remaining 
gaps for 2019 and 2020.

LEBANON CRISIS RESPONSE PLAN 2017-2020 PART I : Needs Overview . 
NEEDS OVERVIEW 
The concerted response by the Government, international 
partners and civil society has prevented a sharp decline 
in socio-economic vulnerability levels between 2015 and 
2018, compared to the steep deterioration witnessed 
between 2014 and 2015.x 
However, the situation in Lebanon continues to 
be precarious, with extensive humanitarian and 
development needs. The estimated 1.5 million displaced 
Syrians, more than half of whom are women and children, 
add to the 1.5 million Lebanese whose vulnerabilities 
have been exacerbated by the crisis. According to an 
official Census carried out by Central Administration of 
Statistics, the Palestinian Bureau of Statistics and the 
Lebanese Palestinian Dialogue Committeexi in July 2017, 
174,422 Palestinian refugees from Lebanon (PRL) were 
enumerated residing in the 12 official refugee camps and 
in 156 gatherings across Lebanon. A national census in 
Lebanon would be required in order to accurately count 
the individual Palestinian households residing outside 
these areas. On the basis of the census results, for 2019 
planning purposes the figure of 180,000 will be used 
as the estimate for Palestinian refugees from Lebanon, 
taking into account the population natural growth 
rates and migration factors. This figure also excludes 
Palestinian refugees from Syria, which are estimated at 
28,800.xii 
Many of the most vulnerable communities in Lebanon 
are concentrated in specific pockets of the country: 
the majority of deprived Lebanese (67%) and persons 
displaced from Syria (87%) live in the country’s most 
vulnerable cadastres.1 However, after eight years, 
Lebanon has suffered the impact of being a host country, 
on all levels and across all regions. Vulnerable Lebanese 
households face a decrease in income, which has left 
them increasingly unable to meet basic needs, including 
food and healthcare. Displaced Syrian households 
and Palestinian refugees from Syria are suffering the 
impact of protracted displacement, sinking deeper into 
(1) The map of the most vulnerable cadasters will be reviewed and updated based on an 
agreed methodology for targeting as part of the LCRP Mid-Term Review process scheduled 
for the second quarter of 2019. The newly agreed criteria for prioritization of the most 
vulnerable cadasters will be presented to the LCRP Steering Committee for final endorsement 
and will provide the main guidance framework for geographic targeting within the LCRP.

debt2 and resorting to negative coping mechanisms as 
they struggle to meet their families’ needs. Palestinian 
refugees from Lebanon also face challenges, including 
multi-generational poverty and a lack of access to 
decent work opportunities. These conditions continue to 
fuel serious protection concerns and lead to high levels 
of marginalization and vulnerability. 
Eight years into the conflict, poverty levels are high and 
the long-term resilience of the country’s vulnerable 
communities is eroding as they run out of savings and 
struggle to access income. At present, an estimated 
28.5 per cent of Lebanese live below the poverty line,xiii 
of which 470,000 are children.xiv More than 68 per cent 
of displaced Syrians are living below the poverty line,xv 
along with 65 per cent of Palestinian refugees from 
Lebanon and 89 per cent of Palestinian refugees from 
Syria, who are one of the most vulnerable groups in the 
region.xvi 
Overall, 97 per cent of households resort to some type 
of livelihood coping strategy. In 2018, households 
reported a general tendency to adopt less severe coping 
strategies. In particular, the use of crisis strategies 
registered a decrease from 55 per cent (2017) to 51 per 
cent (2018). As a consequence, the share of households 
(2) According to the VASyR 2018, average debt per capita is now at $250, compared with 
$211 in 2017. 
resorting to stress coping increased, going from 30 per 
cent to 34 per cent. Despite the slightly positive trend, 
the protracted crisis situation severely affects refugee 
households’ capacities to build a sustainable income 
in the medium to long term and 12 per cent of them 
still reported the use of emergency coping strategies, 
which severely impact on their well-being. At the same 
time, the share of households not adopting any coping 
strategy was extremely low (3%).3 
As a result, households are also sinking deeper into debt: 
displaced Syrians have an average debt of $1,016 per 
household, an increase from $919 in 2017.xvii It is estimated 
that around 71 per cent of Palestinian refugees from 
Syria are in debt while the greatest portion of their debt 
(approximately 80%) is related to funds used for food.4 
Moreover, debt is also a concern for the Lebanese host 
community as evidenced by the 2015 Food Security and 
Livelihoods Assessment of Lebanese, which indicates 
that more than half of interviewed Lebanese households 
reported having incurred debt in the last 24 months.xviii 
Socio-economic vulnerabilities, exacerbated by the 
protracted emergency, are worse amongst femaleheaded 
households, and even higher for those living in 
families with disabilities,xix who are also less food secure, 
have worse diets, adopt severe coping strategies more 
often, and have higher poverty levels.xx This situation has 
also translated, according to UN reports, into an increase 
in the levels of violence against children and women. 
There is continued reliance on harmful practices such as 
child marriage, with 22 per cent of displaced Syrian girls 
aged 15 to 19 being married.xxi Women and girls bear the 
brunt of incidents of gender-based violence (GBV), and 
whilst incidents of GBV are underreported, 93 per cent 
of survivors who reported and sought assistance were 
women and girls, 7 per cent men and boys.xxii Children in 
female headed household are twice as likely to work as 
children with a male headed household.xxiii In addition, 
there is a risk of engagement of children in the worst 
forms of child labour, 5 as there is an increased risk of

traffickers preying on the heightened vulnerability of 
populations. Early marriage and child labour have a 
significant impact on children’s health and psychological 
wellbeing. The Government of Lebanon constantly 
reaffirms its commitment to combat violence against 
children and women, in accordance with applicable 
international standards and national legislation. Joint 
efforts between partners and the Government are 
needed in order to remedy this situation. 
Persons with disabilities are at high risk of violence, 
discrimination and exclusion. These risks are exacerbated 
in protracted emergency settings, and limited targeted 
interventions are in place aimed at reducing inequities. 
This is specifically the case for children living with 
disabilities and their families. A data gap on disability 
persists in Lebanon, limiting the targeting of interventions 
aimed at improving the situation for children and youth 
living with disabilities. 
Simplification measures were adopted by the GoL in 
2018 to facilitate displaced persons from Syria’s access to 
birth registration and other civil documents. The Ministry 
of Interior and Municipalities will require continued 
international support to process increased numbers 
of cases in 2019 and beyond, including advocacy and 
awareness raising towards displaced persons from 
Syria to encourage them to obtain civil documentation. 
Remaining challenges, such as access, cost and 
administrative requirements related to obtaining civil 
documentation, continue to be addressed. To ease legal 
residency processes and increase access, in March 2017 
the General Security Office (GSO) announced a waiver 
of legal residency renewal and overstay fees ($200 per 
year, per person aged 15 years and above). The waiver 
applies to displaced Syrians registered with UNHCR 
before 1 January 2015 and who had not renewed their 
residency previously based on tourism, sponsorship, 
property ownership or tenancy in 2015 or 2016. While 
recent data indicates a slight increase, still only 27 per 
cent of displaced Syrians over 15 years of age have legal 
residency.xxiv Overall there are variations in the level to 
which displaced Syrians have obtained legal residence, 
with Akkar (14%) having the lowest level of legal 
residency nationally and the South of Lebanon (54%) 
having the highest. This is partially indicative of differing 
levels of implementation of the waiver by local GSO 
offices due to their absorption capacity and awareness of 
revised procedures. The obstacles that displaced Syrians 
continue to face in obtaining legal residency, particularly 
for those who fall outside of the fee waiver categories, 
impact their mobility and access to essential services, 
and put them at risk of detention and exploitation. 
Addressing these obstacles remains a key priority for 
the Government of Lebanon (GoL) and its partners as 
reflected in the Brussels Partnership Paper.6 
The large presence of displaced populations has also 
increased demand on infrastructure and social 
services, which lack the capacity to meet increased 
needs. The distribution of the displaced Syrian 
population in areas with a high concentration of 
vulnerable Lebanese has also compounded an already 
problematic economic situation, increasing poverty and 
social tensions between different communities while 
deepening the country’s socio-economic disparities. 
Since the start of the crisis, the affected populations in 
Lebanon have experienced a gradual shrinking of space 
for livelihoods and income-generation, translating 
into the inability of poor and displaced families to 
secure their basic needs and access social services. 
Constraints related to residency and labour policies and 
their implementation, as well as challenging market 
conditions, have also compelled displaced Syrians and 
Palestinian refugees from Syria, including children, to 
resort to informal and exploitative labour in order to 
meet the basic needs of their families. Given the limited 
access to the labour market, the two main sources of 
income for displaced Syrians are informal credit7 and 
debt (52%) and food assistance (32%). For Palestinian 
refugees from Syria, 80 per cent rely on cash assistance 
as their main source of income. Developing sustainable 
livelihood activities for people affected by the crisis is a 
key priority for the GoL and its national and international 
partners – as highlighted in the GoL’s Statement of 
Intent for the London Conferencexxv and “A Vision for 
Stabilization and Development in Lebanon” presented 
at the Brussels Conference in 2017 and 2018xxvi – as 
they reduce the dependence of vulnerable populations 
on assistance and, at the same time, increase the 
productivity and income of local communities. 
Prior to the crisis, the housing market did not supply 
(6) The Government of Lebanon with the assistance of its international partners commit 
to ensuring that all eligible refugees can renew their residency free of charge, by further 
upscaling the capacity of the offices of the General Security to process a higher number of 
applications, and by applying the waiver to all. Furthermore, international partners request 
the Government of Lebanon to consider measures to cover all categories of refugees in 
an inclusive manner through the expansion of the residency fee waiver to categories of 
refugees currently not covered.

sufficient accessible and adequate housing units for 
vulnerable Lebanese. The increased pressure on the 
housing market and continued decrease in available 
funds to the sector means that the most vulnerable 
Lebanese and Syrians have limited access to affordable 
and adequate shelter. A 2013 World Bank study linked 
the pre-crisis under-investment in affordable housing 
or rental housing to ‘the development of marginalized 
pockets and informal areas…characterized by poor 
housing conditions and limited access to basic urban 
services and infrastructure’. Housing in Lebanon has 
only been available through the market, with very 
limited engagement in public housing initiatives or other 
measures to support low-income Lebanese. Low-income 
urban Lebanese households have typically accessed 
shelter in disadvantaged neighborhoods including 
those in and adjacent to Palestinian camps. 
Post-crisis, the increased pressure on the housing market 
and continued decrease in available funds to the sector 
means that the most vulnerable among Lebanese and 
Syrians have limited access to affordable and adequate 
shelter. 
Whilst there is no representative data on the shelter 
conditions of poor Lebanese, illustrative snapshots from 
neighborhood profiles of vulnerable urban areas show 
that the difficulties in accessing secure, adequate and 
affordable housing are shared by Lebanese and non- 
Lebanese low income groups. Significant proportions of 
Lebanese in deprived urban pockets live in buildings with 
structural or exterior conditions that are in substandard 
or critical condition, with precarious communal space 
standards. Whilst lower than amongst Syrian households, 
overcrowding is also a feature for many. 
In 2018, there has been a marked deterioration 
in shelter conditions amongst displaced Syrian 
households: 34 per cent of households now live in nonresidential 
or non-permanent structures as compared 
with 26 per cent in 2017. The lack of durability of shelter 
materials in informal settlements (ISs) means that 
people with specific needs (PwSN), elderly individuals, 
persons with disabilities, female-headed households 
and children can face particular risks. This includes 
difficulties in weatherproofing their shelters, which 
means an additional financial burden that could lead 
to decreased spending on other basic needs such as 
food and health. In parallel, there has been an increase 
in the average monthly rent for these types of shelters. 
Displaced Syrians are now paying on average $57 per 
month for non-permanent shelters, an increase of $22 
from 2017 and $149 for non-residential shelters, with 
an increase of $13. Three in ten refugees were living 
in substandard shelters, and another 5.5 per cent 
living in dangerous shelter conditions.xxvii This trend is 
particularly worrying in Baalbek-Hermel and the Bekaa 
where 53 per cent and 50 per cent of households live in 
substandard shelters. Additionally, the shelter conditions 
are declining in the densely populated low income innercity 
neighbourhoods where adequate shelters are in 
short supply for the affected populations. Overcrowding 
among displaced Syrians has increased slightly in 2018, 
with 34 per cent living with less than 4.5m2 per person. 
This is also high amongst Palestinian refugees from Syria, 
with 46 per cent living in overcrowded conditions.xxviii 
Municipal measures such as eviction notices continue to 
present multiple protection challenges for displaced 
persons. Against the backdrop of growing frustrations 
in municipalities and host communities, acceptance 
by host communities and local authorities of displaced 
people relocating within Lebanon due to evictions is 
becoming increasingly challenging. VASyR recorded an 
average of 13,000 evictions, approximately affecting 
100,000 people on a yearly basis.xxix Security of tenure 
is limited, with most refugees renting on informal verbal 
agreements, making them more susceptible to evictions. 
Intercommunal interaction is decreasing and displaced 
Syrians and host communities are living increasingly 
parallel lives. This, coupled with the rise of certain hostile 
discourses in social media against displaced Syrians, 
primarily around the issue of return, pose particular 
challenges for ensuring continued protection and 
reinforcing social stability in Lebanon.xxx 
Vulnerable populations continue to live in poor urban 
areas where living conditions remain difficult. Rent has 
increased in large urban areas alongside pressure 
on the provision of basic services such as water, 
energy, sanitation and solid waste collection, in addition 
to social stability challenges. It is estimated that 
poor urban neighbourhoods and Palestinian 
refugee camps now host a larger proportion than 
ever before of displaced Syrians. An increased number 
of displaced Syrians living in urban areas makes it 
harder for organizations to assist, since people in need 
are more dispersed and difficult to identify and 
locate, as does the shortage of data and limited 
availability of partners with experience in urban

challenges in obtaining information on access to services 
such as health and education, and to make informed 
decisions. 
The food security situation remains critical, despite 
a slight improvement over the past year. 90 per cent 
of displaced Syrians continue to display some degree 
of food insecurity in 2018. Baalbek-Hermel, Akkar and 
North Lebanon continue to have the highest prevalence 
of food insecurity, joined by Mount Lebanon, with more 
than 35 per cent of households reporting moderate 
and severe food insecurity.xxxi The majority of Syrian 
households – 57 per cent – fall in the mild food insecurity 
category, whilst 31 per cent are moderately food insecure 
and 2.5 per cent are severely food insecure. The situation 
is even worse among Palestinian refugees from Syria, 
63 per cent of whom are severely food insecure and 
31 per cent moderately food insecure.xxxii In addition, 
49 per cent of Lebanese have reported being worried 
about their ability to source enough food, while 31 per 
cent say they were unable to eat healthy and nutritious 
food over the course of a year.xxxiii The food insecurity 
of vulnerable families also has a negative impact on 
the nutrition of their children and infants, particularly 
as exclusive breastfeeding rates are low among the 
Lebanese community (25%).xxxiv Among displaced Syrians 
breastfeeding rates have increased significantly from 
34 per cent in 2017 to 42 per cent in 2018.xxxv Lebanon 
currently does not have a national infant and young child 
feeding policy to guide optimal child nutrition during 
the first two years of life. 
In terms of education, around 631,209 Syrian children 
aged 3-18 years old are located in Lebanon.8 These 
children affected by the conflict, in addition to 447,409 
vulnerable Lebanese children (3-18 years), are in 
need of education assistance. Despite the Ministry of 
Education and Higher Education (MEHE) and education 
partners’ efforts, it is estimated that 40 per cent of the 
displaced Syrians (3-18) – more than 250,000 – remain 
out of certified education (formal and non-formal). The 
enrolment rates significantly drop in lower secondary, 
and the out-of-school rates are highest among 15-to-18- 
year-old Syrians, with around 6 percent of 15-18-year-old 
registered Syrian refugees enrolled in formal education 
(secondary schools and Technical Vocational (TVET) 
public schools).xxxvi Social, economic and academic

barriers have hindered enrolment of children and youth 
in the public education system. As desperate families 
are forced to rely on their children to earn money, child 
labour becomes a major barrier to school enrolment and 
attendance For Palestinian refugees, 32,433 children of 
compulsory school age (6-14) are enrolled in UNRWA 
schools during the 2018/19 school year. With only one of 
65 UNRWA schools running double shift, most of the PRS 
children attend class with their PRL peers. However, due 
to overcrowded classrooms and the lack of staff to cope 
with the additional caseload, the learning environment 
is impacted. 
Since the onset of the crisis, Lebanon’s healthcare 
facilities have been overstretched by an increase in 
utilization, 30 per cent of service recipients through 
Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) primary healthcare 
centres are displaced Syrian women, men, girls and 
boys. This challenges the absorption capacity of the 
centres as well as their financial sustainability. The overall 
health status of Palestinian refugees from Syria is poor, 
with 83 per cent reporting having at least one family 
member who suffers from a chronic illness.xxxvii While 
both Palestinian refugees from Lebanon and Palestinian 
refugees from Syria receive free-of-charge primary 
healthcare services and support for hospitalization 
through UNRWA, many displaced Syriansxxxviii and 
vulnerable Lebanese require financial subsidies to access 
timely and adequate healthcare. In 2018, 13 per cent 
of displaced Syrian households who required primary 
healthcare services were not able to access them, mainly 
for reasons related to treatment costs and doctors’ fees. 
Financial support for hospitalization is limited to lifethreatening 
and obstetric conditions, and only 75 per 
cent of the hospitalization fees is covered. Thus, there are 
large unmet needs, particularly for conditions which do 
not fall under current coverage, including catastrophic 
illnesses (such as cancer) and chronic conditions (such 
as dialysis for chronic renal failure) as well as advanced 
diagnostics. While maintaining a direct service delivery 
component to cover critical needs for vulnerable people, 
the priority of the health sector is increasingly shifting 
toward strengthening the health system and enhancing 
institutional resilience. 
While Lebanon remains polio-free, overall vaccination 
coverage rates remain sub-optimal. As a result, health 
security is a rising concern, particularly as it relates to 
communicable diseases. Lebanon has experienced 

PART I : Needs Overview . LEBANON CRISIS RESPONSE PLAN 2017-2020 
16 
outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases (measles 
and mumps) and water-borne diarrhoea, which could 
significantly affect mortality and morbidity levels among 
both the host and displaced populations. In 2018, 867 
cases were classified as measles, requiring an emergency 
response. 81 per cent of these cases were Lebanese and 
19 per cent were displaced Syrians, the high-risk age 
group being children under 5 years.xxxix 
With regard to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), 
already in 2014 it was estimated that the additional 
population pressure had led to an increase of 15 per cent 
of solid waste, 14 per cent of wastewater and 12 per cent in 
water demand aggravating an already fragile situation.xl 
64 per cent of the population in Lebanon does not have 
access to safely managed drinking water services.9 Water 
quality is severely compromised, with over half of all 
water supply networks past their useful life,10 unchecked 
urban sprawl, unsafe solid waste management, 
thousands of informal settlements, and only 3 per cent 
of wastewater treated for bacteriological contamination 
prior to discharge into the ground or waterbodies.11 In 
2017, it was estimated that only 45 per cent of informal 
settlements, representing 69 per cent of people 
living in ISs, are benefitting from desludging services 
compounding the contamination of water sources and 
soil. Adding to the complexity of this situation is the 
proliferation of illegal private boreholes which lead to 
unaccounted-for-water losses from decrepit systems 
and intermittent power supply, and quantities which 
eventually reach the population are substandard and 
unreliable. In these living conditions, poor hygiene 
practices, particularly in relation to handling food and 
water, aggravate the risk of disease, as evidenced in 
food and water borne diseases accounting for up to 60 
per cent of notifiable communicable diseases.12 Women 
and girls report protection risks in accessing water and 
sanitation services at night. Furthermore, governance 
of Lebanon’s water sector is undermined by lack of 
resources, both financial and human, delaying the water 
sector reform that would enable Water Authorities to 
fulfil their mandated role and to realize sustainable 
solutions for water and wastewater service provision.

Electricity Sector in June 2010, which outlines policies, 
investments and reforms aimed at ultimately improving 
service delivery and reducing the fiscal burden.13 The 
Policy Paper also identifies a deficit in installed generating 
capacity, reaching only 61 per cent of the instantaneous 
peak demand in summer. A study undertaken by 
the Ministry of Energy and Water and UNDP in 2016, 
estimated the required increase in the production 
capacity in electricity as a result of the Syrian crisis at 
486MW.xli This is equivalent to five hours of electricity 
supply per day, and is incurring losses to the Government 
of Lebanon and the Lebanese citizens estimated at 
around $333 million per year. The study also showed that 
more than 45 per cent of displaced Syrian households are 
illegally connected to the national grid, thus leading to 
the Government incurring uncovered costs. Insufficient 
electricity supply forces Lebanese, as well as displaced 
Syrians, to further rely on private and environmentallyunfriendly 
generators, which is expensive and further 
increases their economic vulnerability.

RESPONSE STRATEGY 
Strategic Objectives 
As in the previous years, the Government of Lebanon 
(GoL) and national and international partners work 
together to deliver integrated and mutually reinforcing 
humanitarian and stabilization interventions. 
The LCRP promotes the strategic priorities identified 
by the GoL and partners, with interventions aligned to 
national policies and strategies, responding to evolving 
needs, and seeking to complement and build on other 
international assistance in the country. 
The response plan focuses on humanitarian assistance 
to vulnerable communities, including persons displaced 
from Syria, vulnerable Lebanese and Palestinians, but it 
also strongly seeks to expand investments, partnerships 
and delivery models for stabilization as a transition 
towards longer-term development strategies. 
1 Ensure protection of vulnerable 
populations 
2 Provide immediate assistance to 
vulnerable populations 
3 Support service provision through 
national systems 
4 Reinforce Lebanon’s economic, 
social and environmental stability 
1 Ensure protection of vulnerable 
populations 
Recognizing that the imperative of 
protecting people lies at the heart of 
humanitarian action, this response objective 
aims to strengthen protection services 
and interventions for displaced persons 
from Syria and other vulnerable populations, empower 
individuals and mainstream protection across all sectoral 
interventions. It promotes protection of, and access to, 
affected people in accordance with relevant principles 
and instruments of international refugee and human 
rights law ratified by Lebanon. 
• Ensure that persons displaced from Syria have access 
to legal status in accordance with Lebanese laws and 
regulations, while anticipating their return in safety 
and dignity as the preferred durable solution,1 and 
while abiding by the principle of non-refoulement;2 
• Continue granting access to Lebanon for exceptional 
humanitarian cases through the approval of the 
Minister of Social Affairs, while upholding the 
principle of non-refoulement; 
• Continue to provide durable solutions such as 
resettlement and other admissions to third countries; 
• Continue facilitating access to civil documentation, 
including birth, death and marriage registration, for 
persons displaced from Syria as per Lebanese laws, 
regulations and policies; 
• Ensure tailored provision of protection and other 
services for persons with specific needs, such as 
persons with disabilities and older persons as well as 
for women and children; 
• Build the capacity of Lebanese, Palestinian and 
Syrian communities to identify protection concerns, 
provide feedback on programmatic interventions, 
and contribute to the referral of cases to specialized 
service providers; and 
• Support the GoL to enforce laws to prevent 
and address child abuse, sexual and economic 
exploitation, and the worst forms of child labour. 
(1) The position of the Government of Lebanon is that any form of local integration is 
unconstitutional and, therefore, not an option. The Government considers that the only 
durable solution being available for displaced Syrians in Lebanon is their safe return to Syria, 
in accordance with applicable norms of international law and taking into full consideration 
the vital interests of Lebanon as a host country. Resettlement to third countries is seen as an 
alternative durable solution. 
(2) In any refugee situation, the ultimate goal for the United Nations is the realization of 
durable solutions to the plight of refugees. While local integration is not an option for 
displaced Syrians in Lebanon, the dignity and well-being of displaced Syrians must be 
preserved until they can attain durable solutions outside of Lebanon..

LEBANON CRISIS RESPONSE PLAN 2017-2020 PART I : Response Strategy . 
2 Provide immediate assistance to 
vulnerable populations 
This response objective aims to address 
the immediate needs of the vulnerable 
populations (displaced Syrians, vulnerable 
Lebanese, Palestinian refugees from Syria 
and Palestinian refugees from Lebanon), 
prioritizing the most vulnerable through 
temporary solutions, with the aim to mitigate the rapid 
deterioration of social and economic conditions which 
exacerbate protection risks. 
• Provide direct and targeted assistance to the 
most vulnerable populations to ensure their 
protection and meet their survival needs, including 
needs caused by displacement, while ensuring 
complementarity across sectors; 
• Reduce exposure to hunger, homelessness, health 
complications and disease outbreaks, violence, 
abuse and exploitation as well as the worst effects 
of poverty, including resorting to negative coping 
mechanisms, with practices such as child labour, 
begging and early marriage; 
• Continue immediate and temporary service delivery 
in informal settlements, collective shelters, substandard 
dwellings and gatherings; and 
• Continue to respond to emergency humanitarian 
needs as they arise through immediate and 
temporary interventions. 
3 Support service provision through 
national systems3 
This response objective aims to strengthen 
national and local capacities to meet the 
increasingly overwhelming service-related 
needs and seeks to reinforce confidence 
in the equitable access to and quality of 
public services for vulnerable populations. It aims to 
establish or upgrade basic public service infrastructure, 
strengthening service delivery in the most vulnerable 
communities affected by the crisis through the support 
of the Ministry of Social Affairs’ (MoSA) network of Social 
Development Centres as a key gateway. 
• Ensure that all children, including children displaced 
from Syria, can access, learn and be retained in a 
quality learning environment (formal and nonformal4), 
widening the absorption capacity of 
education premises (rehabilitation, expansion and 
construction), in addition to strengthening the 
education system to be able to cater for all children; 
• Ensure support to strengthening social safety nets; 
(3) “National systems” is inclusive of national government and local institutions, NGOs/civil 
society and the private sector. 
(4) Non-formal education is conceived as a means to bridge the gap with formal education. 
• Ensure that the most vulnerable Lebanese and 
displaced populations can access disease prevention 
interventions and affordable healthcare, with a 
focus on accessibility and quality of services and 
controlling disease outbreaks; 
• Protect the most vulnerable, especially children and 
women, older persons and persons with disabilities, 
and other minority groups at risk of violence 
(including abuse, exploitation and neglect), through: 
• increased outreach and responsiveness of 
community and institutional systems; 
• referrals and a full package of services, including 
appropriate support to survivors through a 
robust and coordinated national system; and 
• Extending safe water, sanitation, hygiene and 
energy for the most vulnerable Lebanese and 
persons displaced from Syria by reinforcing 
existing infrastructure. 
• Scale up service delivery mechanisms that are costefficient, 
yet responsive to needs and offer clear 
benefits to all vulnerable communities; and 
• Strengthen government ownership of investments 
made by supporting national planning and 
implementation, monitoring and management 
processes. 
4 Reinforce Lebanon’s economic, social 
and environmental stability 
This response objective aims to strengthen 
productive sectors in expanding economic 
and livelihood opportunities, benefiting 
local development and the most 
vulnerable communities. It aims to invest 
in mitigating the environmental impact of the Syrian 
crisis, ensuring that actions are taken to maintain longterm 
sustainability of the natural eco-system and avoid 
its further degradation. Furthermore, it will invest in 
national and local capacities to promote dialogue that 
mitigates tensions and conflicts at municipal and local 
levels, with a particular focus on youth and adolescents. 
• Promote job creation and support businesses 
to generate income for local economies in poor 
areas benefiting all vulnerable communities, in 
accordance with Lebanese laws and regulations,5 
and the outcomes of the Brussels conferences; 
• Enhance the productive capacities of local microand 
small-to-medium enterprises (MSME) and 
cooperatives through improving local economic 
infrastructure and supporting their capability to 
respond to market demands; 
(5) As per MoL annual decisions related to businesses, occupations and crafts, and jobs that 
must be limited to Lebanese only.

begin to facilitate voluntary repatriation. 
• Inter-community tensions and public pressure for 
returns are likely to increase if sufficient support is 
not provided to Lebanon to mitigate the impact of 
the crisis and reverse the economic crisis and rising 
unemployment. 
Despite ongoing efforts, the majority of displaced 
populations continue to live below the poverty line and 
the pressure on Lebanese institutions to accommodate 
these increased needs, with many needing to be 
upgraded prior to the crisis, continues. A sense of fatigue 
is growing among the communities, as are concerns over 
increase in the use of negative coping mechanisms, 
impeding access to services and ability to cover basic 
needs. 
Some 68 per cent of displaced Syriansxlii live under 
the minimum survival requirements, and 89 per cent 
of Palestinian refugees from Syria and 65 per cent of 
Palestinian refugees from Lebanon are living under the 
poverty line. As for the Lebanese, approximately 10 per 
cent live below the extreme poverty line, with between 
27 and 30 per cent of people in Lebanon living beneath 
the national poverty line7 before the crisis.xliii 
• Vulnerable households will increasingly shift to living 
in non-residential and non-permanent structures 
as living in residential, urban settings becomes 
unaffordable. 
The crisis in Syria continues to have a negative impact 
on the sustainable development of Lebanon and the 
pressures felt by public systems, such as: 
• An improved relationship and trust between service 
providers and customers will increase cost recovery 
and result in better water service provision. 
• Without additional resources, the education sector 
will be unable to absorb an increased number of 
children and youth in formal education. 
• More standardized service provision across primary 
healthcare providers will increase quality of services 
across all regions. 
At the end of 2015, the crisis had cost the Lebanese 
economy an estimated $18.15 billion due to the economic 
slowdown, loss in trade and fiscal revenues as well as 
additional pressure on public services.8,xliv 
• Unemployment levels and informal labour are on 
the rise, especially in some of the country’s poorest 
localities: in some particularly vulnerable areas, 
unemployment is twice the national average. The 
economic downturn has had a disproportionate 
effect on young people, with youth unemployment 
three to four times higher than the overall

(8) World Bank (2017), Preliminary findings of the Economic and Social Impact Assessment of 
the Syrian Conflict on Lebanon: the cumulative cost to Lebanon since the start of the conflict, 
in terms of lowering the GDP growth rate, is $18.15 billion through 2015, and the fiscal 
impact, in terms of lower revenues, is estimated at $4.2 billion during 2012-2015. 
• Promote sustainable agriculture production 
by supporting vulnerable food producers and 
communities and improve agricultural livelihood 
activities; 
• Reduce the impact of the crisis on Lebanon’s 
environment, with a particular focus on integrated 
solid waste management, water and wastewater 
management, use of renewable energy sources 
and energy-efficient products, protection of air 
quality, conservation of land use and ecosystems 
by strengthening good management of natural 
resources and sustainable investments abiding by 
environmental regulations; 
• Support government institutions and government 
partners to implement necessary economic, labour, 
social welfare, disaster risk management and 
environmental protection reforms; 
• Address social and economic risks faced by Lebanese, 
displaced Syrians and Palestinian adolescents and 
youth with a particular focus on empowering young 
women and girls, including through TVET and decent 
work opportunities;6 
• Prevent social tensions from further rising within 
stressed communities by strengthening the 
capacities of government, local systems and 
mechanisms, and individuals to address critical 
needs and promote intra- and inter-community 
dialogue, with full respect of the Lebanese laws and 
regulations; and 
• Strengthen national emergency preparedness and 
response capacity. 
Planning assumptions 
The planning assumptions for the LCRP 2019 were 
developed through a participatory process with 
representatives from government institutions, UN 
agencies, and international and national NGOs. In 
addition to the below key assumptions, each sector 
strategy has incorporated an analysis of planning 
assumptions, risks and mitigating measures in their 
respective theories of change. 
Context: 
• It is assumed that, pending a political solution in Syria, 
the crisis will continue. While important obstacles 
to large-scale returns in safety and dignity remain, 
some spontaneous returns of displaced Syrians 
from Lebanon to Syria are taking place, particularly 
since 2017. Group returns are also facilitated by 
the Directorate General of General Security since 
early 2018. Nevertheless, the number of Syrians in 
Lebanon is expected to remain relatively stable in 
2019. The number of sustainable returns to Syria will 
substantially increase if obstacles to voluntary, safe 
and dignified returns are removed and the UN can

LEBANON CRISIS RESPONSE PLAN 2017-2020 PART I : Response Strategy . 
unemployment rate.9,xlv Thus, investment in the 
strengthening of public systems and economic 
opportunities remains essential for Lebanon. 
• Increased access to sustainable livelihoods, including 
through provision of work permits, will decrease 
the need for cash and food assistance. Having a 
work permit will be taken into consideration when 
identifying the most vulnerable in need of assistance. 
In accordance with the principle of international 
solidarity and accountability,xlvi the response will be 
developed based on priorities, needs, and capacities, 
and partners will continuously seek feedback from the 
populations that they serve and address concerns about 
the response raised by the affected populations. 
• The data available and targeting used allows for 
identification of particular profiles of vulnerability 
amongst the populations in need and takes into 
account geographical diversity in terms of capacity 
and pressure. 
Governance: The LCRP underscores its national 
leadership by the Government of Lebanon through the 
Ministry of Social Affairs and reaffirms the international 
community’s commitment to support and reinforce 
the response capacity of national/local institutions and 
national/local humanitarian actors. 
• The response strategy allows for linkages and 
complementarity with longer-term development 
plans, enabling a shift towards more sustainable 
delivery of support and services. 
• Partnerships with development actors and civil 
society actors are in place to allow for complementary 
approaches to the response, within a whole-ofsociety 
approach. 
• The coordination framework is sufficient to allow 
integrated approaches that avoid overlap and 
ensure adequate coverage and prioritization. 
• Support to public institutions builds sustainable 
capacities, and strengthens service delivery. 
Population planning figures: The LCRP addresses the 
very diverse needs of four target groups: 1.5 million 
vulnerable Lebanese (49.7% are female; 50.3% male; 
31.15% children); 1.5 million displaced Syrians (51.6% 
female; 48.4% male; 54.1% children); 28,800 Palestinian 
refugees from Syria (49.58% female; 50.42% male; 42.11% 
children) and 180,000 Palestinian refugees (49.58% 
female; 50.42% male; 34.78% children) from Lebanon 
living in 12 camps and 156 gatherings. 
Funding trends: The calls for burden-sharing continue 
throughout the four-year plan that ask for investment in 
Lebanon and support to the population that Lebanon 
hosts. At the same time, increasing advocacy with donor 
countries will focus on putting in place mechanisms that 
provide persons displaced from Syria with humanitarian 
access to third countries, as well as mechanisms for 
(9) Arab Weekly Digest, Interview with Minister of Labor, Beirut, August 2017: Lebanese 
unemployment rate is around 25 per cent, with 37 per cent for youth under 35 years of age, 
and 18 per cent for women. 
economic development. 
The international community should also bring essential 
support to Lebanon through other funding streams, 
including development assistance and other funding 
mechanisms, as it is assumed that the level of funding to 
the LCRP may not be sustained throughout the duration 
of the four-year plan. 
Predictable and multi-year funding is required to 
implement more sustainable solutions. 
Alignment with other planning 
frameworks 
The LCRP is aligned with the following key processes and 
frameworks: 
• As the second edition of the LCRP, the 2017-2020 
framework response is the successor of the 2015- 
2016 LCRP. Within the four-year framework, this plan 
seeks to expand the stabilization and development 
focus and facilitate the transition of crisis response to 
national structures and systems, while maintaining a 
robust and integrated humanitarian and stabilization 
response to the protracted crisis. This medium-term 
strategic planning framework aims to address national 
objectives and priorities to respond to the impact of the 
Syrian crisis in Lebanon, and has been developed and 
implemented in collaboration with the Government 
of Lebanon, the UN, national and international NGOs, 
and donors. Yearly appeals, including multi-year 
programmes, are developed based on an annual review 
of needs. 
• The 2017-2020 LCRP is the Lebanon chapter of the 
Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan 2018-2019 
(3RP) led by UNHCR and UNDP. The 3RP is a regional 
plan that sets out the response to the humanitarian, 
protection and assistance needs of refugees from 
Syria and other impacted persons, communities and 
institutions in the five countries hosting displaced 
Syrians, i.e. Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt. 
As a nationally-owned chapter of the 3RP, the LCRP is 
tailored to respond to the specific needs of Lebanon 
and vulnerable populations within this ongoing 
regional crisis. It ensures that humanitarian and 
stabilization interventions are mutually reinforcing to 
deliver value, and emphasizes support to Lebanon’s 
national capacities, including its aid and assistance 
management efforts. 
• The LCRP incorporates priority measures articulated in 
the GoL’s 2013 Roadmap of Priority Interventions 
for Stabilization from the Syrian Conflictxlvii and 
its updated projects, and furthers its three objectives: 
(i) to restore and expand economic and livelihood 
opportunities for vulnerable groups; (ii) to restore and 
build resilience in equitable access to and quality of 
sustainable public services; and (iii) to strengthen social 
stability. Programmes implemented directly by line 
ministries are represented in the LCRP’s results matrix. 

PART I : Response Strategy . LEBANON CRISIS RESPONSE PLAN 2017-2020 
22 
All LCRP projects investing in Lebanon’s capacities are 
linked to needs articulated in the Roadmap, particularly 
the first two tracks. Furthermore, the LCRP is fully 
aligned with the priority outcomes of international 
donor conferences in London (February 2016) and 
Brussels (April 2017 and April 2018). 
• The shorter-term funding appealed for through the 
LCRP is complemented by the Concessional Financing 
Facility (CFF) currently benefitting Lebanon and 
Jordan. This facility is focused on providing concessional 
financing to middle income countries most affected by 
the presence of large numbers of refugees. With an 
initial focus on the Syrian crisis as it impacts Jordan and 
Lebanon, and with a primary focus on infrastructure, 
the CFF has been adapted to address the impacts of 
current and future refugee crises on a global scale. So 
far, $ 330 million has been approved with an additional 
$295 million pledged to the Concessional Financing 
Facility for Lebanon. 
• The LCRP specifically focuses on the impact of the Syrian 
crisis in Lebanon and is complemented by a number 
of multi-lateral and bi-lateral cooperation agreements 
such as the EU-Lebanon Partnership Priorities and 
Compact 2016-2020,xlviii the World Bank Country 
Partnership Framework for Lebanonxlix and, most 
notably, the United Nations Strategic Framework 
(see point 6 below). 
• The LCRP is fully aligned with and complementary to 
the 2017-2020 United Nations Strategic Framework 
(UNSF),l the UN’s cooperation framework with 
Lebanon, which provides the overall vision for UNwide 
engagement in-country implemented through 
the country programmes of its specific UN agencies, 
funds and programmes. The UNSF articulates the 
UN’s support to the Government of Lebanon towards 
achieving the following priorities: (i) all people in 
Lebanon have peace and security; (ii) Lebanon enjoys 
domestic stability and practices effective governance; 
and (iii) Lebanon reduces poverty and promotes 
sustainable development while addressing immediate 
needs in a human rights/gender sensitive manner. The 
UNSF reaffirms humanitarian principles in relation to 
the impact of the Syrian crisis, including the needs of 
1.5 million displaced Syrians, and acknowledges the 
continued requirement for a Lebanon Crisis Response 
Plan (LCRP) that supports vulnerable populations 
affected by the crisis while also strengthening the 
resilience of local institutions and the host community 
to manage the current situation. UN support for the 
2017-2020 LCRP is outlined in the UNSF. 
• The LCRP aligns with GoL’s strategies and contains 
interventions developed as part of the regional No 
Lost Generation strategy (NLG), specifically through 
support to the RACE II Strategy, and other sectoral 
investments in protection, psychosocial support and 
skill development for children, adolescents and youth, 
such as the Ministry of Social Affairs’ National Plan to 
Safeguard Children and Women in Lebanon (MoSA NP) 
and the Ministry of Education and Higher Education 
National Child Protection Policy. The LCRP Education 
and Protection sectors contain the GoL-endorsed 
budget for RACE II and the MoSA NP implementation, 
captured through UN agencies, donors and 
participating NGOs, and the funding appeals by MEHE 
and MoSA, with a view to moving to full government 
implementation. 
• The LCRP is coherent with the Dead Sea Resilience 
Agendali endorsed at the Resilience Development 
Forum held in Jordan in November 2015, which brought 
together representatives of governments of countries 
affected by the Syrian crisis, UN, international and 
national NGOs, the donor community and the private 
sector to discuss key guiding principles and elements 
of a medium-term regional response. 
• The LCRP strives to implement the commitments 
made by more than 30 of the largest humanitarian 
partners through the Grand Bargainlii at the World 
Humanitarian Summit in 2016. Ten key commitments 
were made to: ensure greater transparency; more 
support and funding tools for local and national 
responders; increase the use and coordination of 
cash-based programming; reduce duplication and 
management costs with periodic functional reviews; 
improve joint and impartial needs assessments; include 
people receiving aid in making the decisions which affect 
their lives; increase collaborative humanitarian multiyear 
planning and funding; reduce the earmarking of 
donor contributions; harmonize and simplify reporting 
requirements; and enhance engagement between 
humanitarian and development actors. 
• Many LCRP projects also integrate the principles of 
the UN Sustainable Development Goals,liii a set 
of globally-agreed goals to end poverty, protect the 
planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of the 2030 
Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
• The LCRP strives to ensure the commitments in the New 
York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, and the 
recommendations contained in the Comprehensive 
Refugee Response Frameworkliv annexed to the 
Declaration.

Governance mechanism 
The 2017-2020 LCRP will continue to ensure that the 
coordination structure aligns with both the humanitarian 
and stabilization dimensions of the response, under the 
overall leadership of the Minister of Social Affairs and the 
UN Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator:11 
LCRP sectors are coordinated through the Inter-Sector 
Working Group led by MoSA, a mechanism that 
reports to the leadership body of the LCRP and includes 
LCRP sector leads from line ministries, as well as sector 
coordinators, and key response partners as per the 
terms of reference of the Inter-Sector Working Group. 
In accordance with their specialized mandates, UNHCR 
and UNDP act as co-chairs. This mechanism reports to 
the LCRP Steering Committee co-chaired by the Minister 
of Social Affairs and the UN Resident Coordinator/ 
Humanitarian Coordinator and includes Government 
ministries12 as well as members of the Inter-Ministerial 
Committees and key response partners from the UN, 
donors and NGOs. 
Sector Steering Committees are supported by working 
groups from the involved national and international 
partners that contribute to the technical and operational 
coordination of sector-specific issues including 
monitoring of progress and sharing of information, 
experiences and challenges. Sector working groups 
will report to the Sector Steering Committees, and will 
not duplicate the functions of the latter. Relevant terms 
of reference were revised in 2016 to reflect these roles, 
responsibilities and reporting lines (see the TORs in 
Annex 5). 
Aid coordination: Efforts are ongoing to improve aid 
management under the leadership of MoSA in order 
to assist in coordinating GoL/donor/UN/World Bank 
priorities, and in tracking funding against those priorities. 
(11) The UN Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator is accountable for oversight of 
humanitarian and development responses in countries through the Inter-Agency Standing 
Committee (IASC) for coordination of humanitarian action and the Delivering-As-One 
initiative of the UN Secretary-General. Under these principles, lead agencies for specific 
sectors in Lebanon are accountable for representing the interest of their sectors at every 
level of response management. 
(12) MoIM, MoSA, MoL, MoPH, MoFA, MEHE, MoET, MoF, MoA, MoEW, MoE, PMO, HRC, and

Implementation Framework 
Authority & Accountability: The GoL’s Inter-Ministerial 
Committee on Displaced is the highest national authority 
for international partners supporting the crisis response 
inside Lebanese territory, including through the LCRP, in 
accordance with Lebanese laws and regulations as well 
as applicable international law. 
Oversight: The Ministry of Social Affairs is mandated 
by the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Displaced to lead 
and oversee the Government’s response to the crisis in 
Lebanon. The LCRP Steering Committee is co-chaired 
by the Minister of Social Affairs and the United Nations 
Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator, and 
includes participation of members of the Inter-Ministerial 
Committee on Displaced and other public institutions, 
humanitarian and stabilization partners across the UN, 
national and international NGOs, and donors. 
Planning and Coordination: LCRP activities are 
coordinated, under the direct guidance of MoSA, with line 
ministries through sector steering committees and sector 
working groups, with the support of sector-coordinating 
UN agencies, donors, the World Bank and NGO partners 
– also engaging Lebanon’s civil society and private 
sector where necessary. LCRP progress and strategies 
will be steered by the Government of Lebanon through 
MoSA in collaboration with the UN, as represented by 
the UN Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator, 
and will be supported by the Office for the Coordination 
of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) with the Inter-Ministerial 
Committee on Displaced and the lead UN agencies for 
refugee and stabilization responses (UNHCR and UNDP 
respectively). 
The current structure and management of LCRP sectors 
is organized at the national level as below, with similar 
structures operating in five operational areas of Lebanon:

25 
LEBANON CRISIS RESPONSE PLAN 2017-2020 PART I : Response Strategy . 
Principles for LCRP 
Implementation 
Sector steering committees provide relevant 
information and facilitate operation of partners for 
successful implementation of projects in the field, 
under the direct leadership of and in coordination with 
MoSA’s LCRP team throughout Lebanon. To ensure 
efficiency and avoid duplication, the LCRP coordination 
structure remains the only system through which 
partners coordinate efforts to respond to the Syrian 
crisis in Lebanon. 
Planning 
The LCRP Steering Committee guides the allocation of 
unearmarked funding and other resources among the 
sectors following participatory consultations with the 
relevant stakeholders, and in a timely manner. 
In line with LCRP Steering Committee guidance, sector 
steering committees ensure alignment of unearmarked 
funding to key priorities and underfunded needs of the 
LCRP. 
For unearmarked funding, sectors present their 
recommendations to the MoSA and UN lead partners, 
which would coordinate with the relevant donors on 
the allocation of funding, working through funding 
instruments such as the Lebanon Recovery Fund. 
Appealing partners commit to use earmarked funding 
in coordination with sector steering committees and in 
adherence to agreed LCRP sector outcomes and outputs. 
The LCRP partners review progress on agreed objectives 
and impact through regular and ad hoc meetings of sector 
steering committees and the LCRP Steering Committee. 
Planning of programmes should be coordinated through 
sectors, in close collaboration with line ministries under 
MoSA’s leadership, through a bottom-up field-based 
approach that takes into consideration the national 
priorities and needs identified by each line ministry and 
in line with the Lebanese laws, rules and regulations. 
Information sharing and tracking 
Appealing partners are responsible for reporting fully 
and in a timely manner on funding and other resources 
received, through agreed coordination and reporting 
mechanisms that are systematic and transparent to the 
Government of Lebanon’s Inter-Ministerial Committee 
on Displaced, through MoSA and the UN Resident 
Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator. 
Funding and other resources received and/or committed 
should be reported to the LCRP Steering Committee led 
by MoSA and the UN Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian 
Coordinator. 
LCRP implementing partners are responsible for 
reporting on a regular basis, through agreed systems, 
to the relevant sector steering committee on the 
progress/achievements of the activities that they are 
implementing. 
Sector steering committees report on progress and 
achievements to the LCRP Steering Committee. The 
format, content and frequency of reports will be decided 
at the start of the implementation period. 
Financing the LCRP 
The financing of the LCRP presents an opportunity 
to strengthen aid architecture and harmonization in 
Lebanon. Humanitarian and development needs set out 
in the LCRP will continue to be funded on an appeal basis, 
both bilaterally through a variety of donor mechanisms 
and trust funds, as well as pooled funds such as the Multi- 
Partner Trust Fund (MPTF) managed by the World Bank, 
the UN-managed Lebanon Humanitarian Fund (LHF) and 
the Lebanon Recovery Fund (LRF) chaired by GoL. 
Cost-sharing opportunities will be explored with the 
Government, along with public-private partnerships, 
to support government implementation of Roadmap 
projects. The introduction of an overall Lebanon 
Financial Aid Tracking System, building on existing 
systems, will also enable better planning of investment 
coordination between GoL and its international partners 
to ensure a predictable level of support to communities. 
Further efforts will focus on broadening the diversity 
of funding, including through donors from the MENA 
region, members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, and 
other partners. 
Communicating the LCRP 
The LCRP will be supported by an integrated multiagency 
communication strategy, led by the Government 
(MoSA). Communication priorities will include: (i) 
maintaining international momentum in support 
of Lebanon’s stability and finding durable solutions 
to the crisis; (ii) fostering an international sense of 
accountability for Lebanon’s vulnerable populations; 
(iii) strengthening government leadership of Lebanon’s 
assistance frameworks; (iv) fostering inter-communal 
understanding and acceptance; and (v) joint messaging 
on key achievements and critical needs.

Principles of partnership and 
accountability 
As a basis for addressing its key priorities, strengthening 
partnership and enhancing the overall effectiveness of 
the LCRP, several core principles and commitments have 
been agreed between GoL and its international partners 
in order to: 
• Enhance the effectiveness, operationalization and 
transparency of the LCRP, and the predictability of 
funding, by complementing its guiding principles. 
• Provide guidance, applicable to all LCRP partners, 
for a timely, effective and coordinated response, by 
clarifying requirements with respect to key functions 
and processes: information sharing and tracking, 
planning and implementation. 
• Ensure synergies between national planning and 
partner responses, by aligning LCRP efforts with 
national strategies and agreed plans, and by enabling 
line ministries to play a stronger role in leadership 
and coordination at the national and local levels 
under the guidance of MoSA, while benefiting from 
the support of the UN, donors and NGOs. 
• Enhance the localization of the response with national 
actors involved in the design and coordination with 
adequate efforts to build Lebanon’s capacity and 
systems for future crisis prevention and response.13,lvi 
• Ensure accountability to affected populations. LCRP 
partners will continue to ensure that the response 
engages affected populations and local authorities 
in local programme design, under the guidance and 
coordination of MoSA and relevant UN coordinating 
agencies. This includes, where possible, regular 
visits aimed at obtaining feedback from vulnerable 
communities on needs, targets and effectiveness of 
LCRP interventions. Plans in 2017-2020 will facilitate 
access of affected populations to communication 
processes in which they are able to ask questions, 
provide feedback and contribute to discussions 
about current and longer-term strategies. 
• Enhance the multi-sectoral approach of the 
LCRP based on a comprehensive and a common 
understanding of risks, taking into account threats, 
vulnerabilities and coping capacities at the individual, 
community and institution level, in support of the 
Sustainable Development Goal Agenda of leaving 
no one behind. 
(13) Within the Regional Refugee and Resilience Response Plan (3RP), principles for a 
localized response are as follows: (a) local actors influence the design of the response by 
feeding in the needs, priorities and social dynamics of populations affected by the Syrian 
crisis; (b) coordination mechanisms are led by government actors where possible, and all 
local actors are able to participate in and contribute to coordination processes at national 
and sub-national levels; (c) partnerships between international and local organizations/ 
institutions ensure equity and joint responsibility, as well as visibility for local actors within 
the 3RP response; (d) initiatives jointly undertaken by international and local organizations 
include a strong element of capacity development in order to build local capacity and 
systems for future crisis prevention and response in the region; and (e) the maximum amount 
of direct, quality funding as possible is channeled to national and local actors in order to 
allow them to respond to the needs of crisis-affected populations while simultaneously 
investing in their own institutional capacities. 
Cross-cutting issues 
The seven following cross-cutting issues are mainstreamed 
across sectors under the LCRP, as they have been 
designated as key priorities by all partners. 
Better understanding vulnerability and risk to 
strengthen multi-sectoral approaches 
The term “most vulnerable” is currently defined within 
the sectors, mainly using socio-economic, geographic 
or categorical concepts of vulnerability. These concepts 
have informed sectors in targeting their response. 
Understanding vulnerability by focusing on risks will 
facilitate a more multi-disciplinary and integrated 
approach that incorporates different perspectives and 
promotes involvement of a wide-range of actors. It will 
allow for a tailoring of interventions to the specific context. 
Circumstances and factors at the individual, community 
and institutional level can increase a person’s vulnerability 
and/or reduce their capacity to cope with a particular 
situation. The LCRP will move towards a multi-dimensional 
understanding of vulnerability – considering internal risk 
factors, likelihood to experience harm, capacity to recover 
and adapt to new situations, ability to resist and insurance 
against new shocks - to better harmonize the response. 
Programming decisions and targeting of displaced 
populations will be informed through a comprehensive 
analysis of risk, considering vulnerability in relation to 
threats and coping capacities. 
Sectors will build on the thematic conversations 
developed over the course of 2018 to further strengthen 
the alignment of targeting approaches, systematize 
referral mechanisms and co-design mechanisms for 
redress when persons are left behind as particular types 
of assistance shift in scope and scale. 
Protection 
The protracted nature of displacement in Lebanon has 
impacted different segments of the population differently, 
due to their particular vulnerabilities, coping capacities 
and susceptibility to threats. The LCRP is committed to a 
protection-centered response. All assistance promotes 
meaningful access, safety, dignity and basic rights of 
affected people. Protection is mainstreamed through 
the response, at the national and field levels. Through a 
common understanding of the protective environment, 
sectors ensure due consideration, and responses which 
take into account the respective needs and multidimensional 
vulnerabilities of individuals they serve, 
allowing for more integrated approaches to service 
provision. These efforts will be guided by a joint-protection 
analysis highlighting threats, vulnerabilities and coping 
capacities, which will be shared across sectors to inform 
targeting and tailor common multi-sector approaches. 
Gender and gender- based violence 
Achieving gender equality and eliminating gender-based 
violence (GBV) is one of the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

27 
LEBANON CRISIS RESPONSE PLAN 2017-2020 PART I : Response Strategy . 
Development.14,lvii Mainstreaming gender efficiently 
requires assessing the implications of any planned action 
for women, girls, men and boys, as well as making their 
concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the 
design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of 
policies and programmes in all spheres.15 
Furthermore, recognizing that GBV represents a 
particular challenge in humanitarian contexts and that 
preventing and responding to GBV constitutes a collective 
accountability, the LCRP ensures risk mitigation across all 
sectors of intervention.lviii 
Youth 
The 2017-2020 LCRP prioritizes mainstreaming youth 
programming as a clear and harmonized component 
within its different relevant sector plans. The main goal of 
the youth component is to foster economically, personally 
and socially active and resilient youth in order to increase 
education, entrepreneurship, TVET, empowerment, 
participation, and civic engagement of this cross-cohort.16 
Partners continue to expand their focus on youth 
programming across all sectors to provide this vulnerable 
and marginalized group with a holistic and harmonized 
package of services. These initiatives aim to motivate the 
youth to positively influence their peers and communities. 
As such, youth programming has been expanded under 
the Livelihoods sector through job creation in accordance 
with the Ministry of Labour decisions and the Lebanese 
labour law, increased market-based skills training and 
employability, apprenticeships, income generation 
opportunities, and innovation and entrepreneurship 
programmes. The Education sector tackles youth 
challenges through increasing their access to formal 
education, vocational training and regulated non-formal 
education programmes. The Social Stability sector has 
defined a clear output for the active role of youth in 
stabilizing and building resilience in their communities 
and among their peers. Finally, the Protection sector has 
further detailed the focus on youth at risk of engagement 
in risky behaviours, ensures provision of psycho-social 
support, and addresses gender-based violence, building 
community referral and response mechanisms for at-risk 
girls and boys. 
Environment 
The environment remains a priority and a key area for 
mainstreaming within the LCRP. Under the LCRP 2017-2020, 
the Ministry of Environment (MoE) leads an Environment 
Task Force (cf. the TORs in Annex 7) in close coordination 
with the Government, MoSA and the Inter-Sector Working 
Group with the aim of addressing priority environmental 
impacts and mainstreaming environmental considerations 
into activities and projects. 
In order to do this, MoE will adopt a two-level approach: 
(14) Social Development Goal 5 states: “Achieve gender equality and empower all women 
and girls”. 
(15) See for the full definition of gender mainstreaming: Economic and Social Council), 
Mainstreaming the gender perspective into all policies and programmes in the United Nations 
system, ECOSOC Agreed Conclusions 1997/2, in: A/52/3, p. 28. 
(16) As per MoL annual decisions related to businesses, occupations and crafts, and jobs that 
must be limited to Lebanese only. 
i. Ensure the mainstreaming of environmental 
safeguards in emergency relief and stabilization 
activities and ensure that the institutional capacities 
of MoE are enabled to continue the assessment and 
monitoring of the environmental impacts of the 
Syrian conflict and the provision of relevant technical 
guidance for environmental interventions; and 
ii. Cooperate with all concerned LCRP sectors in the 
identification and implementation of environmental 
interventions, with a specific focus on priority sectors 
(Social Stability, Food Security, Water, Energy) and 
aim for a further roll-out to additional sectors as 
appropriate. 
Conflict sensitivity 
Given the complex social fabric of Lebanon and the 
political impact of the Syrian conflict on the domestic 
scene, the response in Lebanon’s most vulnerable 
localities both shapes conflict dynamics and is shaped by 
them. This must be taken into account in all interventions 
through a conflict-sensitive approach that includes ‘dono-
harm’ principles. This approach is generally defined 
as organizations: (a) understanding the context in 
which they operate, particularly the conflict dynamics, 
drivers of tensions and local capacities for stability; (b) 
understanding the interaction between the context and 
their intervention; and (c) acting on this understanding in 
order to minimize negative impacts of interventions and 
maximize positive impacts on conflict. The response as 
a whole will ensure that this approach is mainstreamed 
across the sectors in a coordinated effort to support the 
continued resilience of Lebanon through the crisis under 
the leadership of MoSA and MoIM. 
Conflict sensitivity is fully incorporated into the LCRP: 
each sector strategy analyzes its potential adverse 
effects on local conflict dynamics and how to maximize 
its contribution to social stability, which in turn guides 
partners’ respective programmes. In addition, regular 
information on tension trends and risks are provided to 
partners as well as research and evaluations on the impact 
of different types of LCRP programming on the level of 
tensions. These analyses are complemented by regular 
trainings and guidance on conflict-sensitivity and ‘do-noharm’ 
approaches, which are provided both to front-line 
workers and programme management staff to ensure 
that they are able to adjust their programmes accordingly. 
Urban areas 
Hosting one out of five displaced Syrians and already 
strained by high levels of deprivation, inadequate access 
to basic services, housing and social stability challenges, 
poor urban areas have been particularly impacted by the 
Syrian crisis. 
By expanding multi-sectoral needs analysis, such as 
the already ongoing Neighbourhood Profiles, partners 
will expand their coverage into urban areas based on 
a multi-dimensional vulnerability approach to provide 
immediate assistance and sustainable solutions in 
partnership with the local authorities.

PART I : RESPONSE Monitoring and Evaluation . LEBANON CRISIS RESPONSE PLAN 2017-2020 
28 
Reinforced and objective monitoring and evaluation 
(M&E) is critical to improving effectiveness and 
accountability. All sector logframes are technically 
reviewed on a yearly basis in consultation with sector 
working groups and stakeholders. Revisions have 
been made based on sector strategies to strengthen 
results chains of change, indicators and measurement 
methodologies at sector level. In parallel, an inter-sector 
M&E framework for 2017-2020 provides a multi-year 
framework for measuring progress against the LCRP’s 
expected impacts, ensuring transparency and facilitating 
strategic and programmatic adjustments. Six impact 
statements aligned with the four strategic objectives of 
LCRP are as follows: 
Strategic objective 1: Ensure protection of vulnerable 
populations 
• Impact 1: Displaced persons from Syria and 
vulnerable populations live in a safe, protective 
environment 
Strategic objective 2: Provide immediate assistance 
to vulnerable populations 
• Impact 2: Immediate humanitarian needs of the 
most vulnerable populations are met 
Strategic objective 3: Support service provision 
through national systems 
• Impact 3: Vulnerable populations have equitable 
access to basic services (health, education, water, 
energy, solid waste, shelter and social protection) 
through national (public and private) system 
Strategic objective 4: Reinforce Lebanon’s economic, 
social and environmental stability 
• Impact 4: Mitigated deterioration in the economic 
condition of vulnerable populations 
• Impact 5: Social stability is strengthened in Lebanon 
• Impact 6: Mitigated environmental impact of 
the Syrian crisis, to avoid further degradation of 
the natural eco-system and ensure its long-term 
sustainability 
The inter-sector framework provides clarity on impact 
measurement and the causal linkages from sector 
outcomes to impact. These causal relationships are 
further detailed in each sector strategy and can guide 
subsequent independent evaluations of the overall 
response by partners. 
In 2018, the response M&E system has been strengthened 
further, as follows: 
• A list of research questions at inter-sector and sector 
levels have been identified to better shape data 
collection and prioritize learning needs across the 
response. These research questions will feed into the 
upcoming mid-term review of the LCRP as well as 
the final evaluation of the response; 
• New qualitative indicators have been incorporated 
in sector logframes to capture the response’s 
accountability to affected populations. Reporting on 
these indicators will start in 2019 and help assess the 
level of engagement of beneficiaries in the response; 
• A monitoring framework of the commitments made 
by the international community and the Government 
of Lebanon at the Brussels 2 conference, organized 
in April 2018 has been developed and incorporated 
into the LCRP M&E system for greater accountability. 
Progress will be reported to the LCRP Steering 
Committee on a yearly basis; and 
• Finally, a mid-term review of the response was 
designed and is expected to be conducted in the 
first quarter of 2019 to: 1) take stock of progress 
since January 2017; 2) review the existing response 
coordination model, and; 3) identify possible 
evolutions of existing frameworks beyond 2020. 
The findings of the mid-term review are expected in 
April 2019 to support decision-making and strategic 
planning. 
Coordination and management: 
M&E is coordinated and managed at all three levels of the 
LCRP institutional and coordination architecture: 
• At the sector level, individual appealing/ implementing 
partners will be responsible for reporting updates on 
progress and resources allocated/used against sector 
strategies and corresponding results frameworks, using 
ActivityInfo. These will be provided to the Sector Steering 
Committees, which will be responsible for reviewing and 
preparing periodic monitoring and progress reports (see 
below). 
• At the inter-sector level, the Inter-Sector working group 
is responsible for monitoring progress against LCRP’s 
impact statements, across the LCRP against sector 
outcomes and outputs. It reports to the LCRP Steering 
Committee. 
• The LCRP Steering Committee will periodically 
review progress on LCRP implementation to inform 
its discussions and decisions on overall strategy and 
implementation issues. 
Tracking and information management system: 
• At sector output and outcome level, the 2017-2020 
Lebanon Crisis Response Plan continues to be monitored 
through ActivityInfo, which reports against a standard 
set of indicators agreed by sectors and helps inform 
progress against sector logframes. 
RESPONSE MONITORING AND 
EVALUATION

29 
LEBANON CRISIS RESPONSE PLAN 2017-2020 PART I : RESPONSE Monitoring and Evaluation . 
• At impact level, macro-level data related to each strategic 
objective will be collected to inform progress. The LCRP 
M&E system links to ActivityInfo as well as a number of 
national surveys using mixed methods. In addition, a 
series of qualitative enquiry processes, including case 
studies, will be conducted to further explore causal 
relationships from sector outcomes to impact statements. 
At the same time, LCRP’s knowledge management function 
will be strengthened to better reflect on and disseminate 
lessons learned across sectors, key findings from surveys 
and policy recommendations. Similarily, GoL/MoSA and 
international partners will examine options for strengthening 
the existing tools and system to make them more accessible, 
improving compatibility with existing government aid 
coordination mechanisms, and expanding analytical and 
reporting functionality. 
Financial tracking and reporting: 
Funds for LCRP programmes will be received and programmed 
in three ways: 1) bilaterally through government ministries 
and institutions; 2) through UN/NGO response partners; and 
3) through pooled funding arrangements. 
MoSA, supported by the UN Resident Coordinator/ 
Humanitarian Coordinator and in collaboration with members 
of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Displaced, will report on 
funds received for the LCRP as part of its quarterly and annual 
reporting, based on consolidated information captured 
in existing financial tracking systems. All humanitarian 
contributions to the LCRP through government and response 
partners will be captured through the financial tracking 
system managed by OCHA. While Lebanon’s aid coordination 
platform is being strengthened, the LCRP financial tracking 
will feed into an overall Lebanon Aid Tracking System 
currently being developed by MoSA and the Ministry of 
Finance with the support of the UN Resident Coordinator/ 
Humanitarian Coordinator’s Office, to improve management 
of multi-lateral and bilateral funding received in Lebanon or 
funding committed. 
Monitoring and evaluation products: A series of 
M&E activities and events will take place during the 
LCRP programming cycle. The LCRP M&E calendar 
includes several M&E products that will be developed 
and disseminated during 2017-2020, including, but not 
limited to, quarterly sectoral dashboards, bi-yearly intersectoral 
dashboards, thematic dashboards (in-focus), 
reviews and an external evaluation. 
Review: Every year, mid-year and final reports on the 
LCRP appeal will be presented by MoSA, supported by 
the Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator, 
under the auspices of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on 
Displaced. As part of this process, the scope of the LCRP 
will be reviewed to ensure that the response continues 
to match evolving needs and the increasing level of 
development support outside the LCRP (if available). The 
Government of Lebanon and its partners will review the 
progress of the LCRP in a process supported by the intersector 
mechanism and coordinated under the leadership 
of MoSA and the UN Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian 
Coordinator, with support from the Inter-Ministerial 
Committee on Displaced, UNDP, UNHCR, and other key 
response partners. The mid-year consultation will set the 
direction for the second half of year and inform the next 
annual appeal.
