Foreword 

In 2018, the crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) drastically worsened, 
spreading to previously unaffected areas and impacting the Great Lakes region. The ongoing 
conflicts across much of eastern and central DRC continue to cause significant displacement, 
damage to property and tragic loss of human life. 

While the majority of displaced people remain within DRC, tens of thousands of new refugees 
have fled across borders since the beginning of 2018. In particular, refugee flows to Burundi, 
Uganda and Zambia have increased significantly. New arrivals in those countries have joined 
refugees from previous waves of violence, the majority being women and children, many of 
whom are crossing borders unaccompanied or separated. 

The unstable security and socio-economic situation in the DRC was further aggravated by an unpredictable political 
environment and outbreaks such as the Ebola virus disease. The risk of further displacement remains high, and thus 
would have a disastrous impact on the precarious humanitarian situation and raise the specter of increased regional 
instability if the crisis is not contained. The underlying drivers of humanitarian needs, including protection, are not 
expected to change in the coming year. At the same time, DRC continues to host over half a million refugees from 
neighbouring countries, many of whom have been displaced due to waves of ongoing violence. 

Looking forward, the 2019-2020 Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRRP) for the DRC situation aims at addressing 
the needs of new arrivals of Congolese refugees in the region, and those in protracted situations. By supporting 
livelihoods opportunities and through a resilience-based approach, refugees will be able to contribute to the 
development of their host countries, and of their country of origin upon their return. Given the limited capacity of host 
communities to support the impact of massive numbers of refugees, the response strategy will also address the needs 
of local populations, strengthening peaceful co-existence and building social cohesion. 

Effective interagency cooperation and coordination is imperative to provide strong leverage for peaceful solutions, the 
delivery of humanitarian assistance, and support to sustainable development. As such, we are pleased to see that the 
number of RRRP partners has increased from 44 in 2018 to 57 for 2019-2020. However, despite the gravity of the crisis, 
the refugee response in 2018 was underfunded, raising concerns over basic needs, including food security, health, 
access to education, and other minimum standards that are often not met, such as proper accommodation in 
overcrowded refugee settlements. 

In the spirit of solidarity, I would like to invite the international community, including UN agencies, international and 
national NGOs, government counterparts, and donors, to reaffirm their commitment to support the persons in need. We 
have a shared responsibility to refugees and host communities, to contribute to the delivery of protection and 
humanitarian assistance, and seek opportunities for development. 

Only by joint efforts can we tackle the challenges and achieve positive and lasting results. 

Thank you for your support!

Regional Overview

Introduction 

The situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(DRC) is a protection crisis, fueled by ethnic and 
political conflicts. The situation has drastically 
worsened over the course of 2018, spreading to 
previously unaffected areas with a dramatic impact on 
the Great Lakes region. The on-going conflicts across 
much of eastern and central DRC have caused and 
continue to cause significant population displacement, 
human rights violations, including targeted attacks 
against civilians, a high prevalence of sexual and 
gender-based violence, and loss of human life and 
property. According to OCHA, the consequences have 
been devastating for 1.37 million internally displaced 
persons who are in need of humanitarian assistance. At 
the same time the DRC hosts over 533,000 refugees 
from Rwanda, the Central African Republic, South 
Sudan and Burundi who fled their countries seeking 
international protection. 

While the main part of the displaced population has 
remained in the country, the Congolese refugee 
population in the region has increased with over 
130,000 new refugees leaving the DRC since the 
beginning of 2018. In particular, refugee flows to 
Burundi, Uganda and Zambia have increased 
significantly, while several thousand refugees have fled 
further south towards Southern Africa and beyond. 
New arrivals have joined refugees from previous waves 
of violence, bringing the total number of Congolese 
refugees in Africa to some 765,000, as at September 
20181. The majority of Congolese refugees are women 
and children and nearly 55 per cent are under 18, many 
crossing borders unaccompanied or separated from 
family members. About 8 per cent of the total population 
are persons with specific needs, including survivors of 
sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), persons 
living with HIV and AIDS and persons with disabilities. 

1 Except where indicated otherwise, all population figures provided in 
this report are as of September 30, 2018. 

The intensified presence of various non-state actors in 
the eastern provinces of the DRC continued during 
2018. Local intercommunal fighting increased including 
in the provinces of Ituri, North Kivu, South Kivu, 
Maniema and Tanganyika, as well as in the Kasaï 
region, creating a dire humanitarian situation. Apart 
from threats coming from armed conflicts, criminality is 
on the rise both in urban and rural areas, facilitated by 
the proliferation of small arms, high unemployment, 
poverty and widespread impunity. 

The political uncertainties, exacerbated by the ongoing 
electoral process, have further aggravated the already 
unstable security and socio-economic situation in the 
country and the risk of further displacement remains 
high. At the same time, the underlying drivers of 

humanitarian needs, including protection, will not 
change in the coming year. 

In Zambia, on 10 September 2017, UNHCR activated a 
Level 1 emergency requiring enhanced preparedness. 
On 16 February 2018, the refugee influx from DRC into 
Uganda declared as a Level 2 emergency followed the 
sharp increase in the number of new arrivals since 18 
December 2017. On 13 August 2018, UNHCR activated 
an internal Level 2 emergency for North Kivu and Ituri 
provinces due to the deteriorating security and 
humanitarian conditions, amidst the outbreak of the 
Ebola virus. In Ituri, violence has displaced over 
300,000 persons in the first half of 2018 and some 
500,000 people have been displaced in North Kivu, 
since the beginning of 2018. 

The 2018 Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRRP) 
for the DRC situation was the first regional inter-agency 
effort to capture the needs of Congolese refugees in 
neighbouring countries. Newly arrived refugees have 
joined existing refugee populations for whom resources 
have been decreasing in recent years and which are 
largely insufficient to cover food security, nutrition, 
health and other basic needs or meet minimum 
standards. In many countries of asylum, refugee 
settlements and camps are already at full capacity. 
Funds for livelihood interventions are limited, 
prolonging refugees’ dependence on external support. 
In this context, providing protection and humanitarian 
assistance to thousands of new refugees seeking 
safety in the course of 2018 have been a challenge for 
host governments and RRRP partners. 

Throughout 2018, RRRP partners strengthened their 
advocacy efforts and promoted access to asylum, as 
well as the maintenance of the civilian and humanitarian 
character of asylum. Given the large scale of 
displacement inside DRC coupled with the limited 
capacity of host communities to support the massive 
numbers of refugees on the move, the emergency 
response was limited to basic shelter, NFI assistance 
and improvements to accessing basic services. In 
cooperation with host governments, mechanisms for 
the registration of refugees were established, physical 
verification exercises were conducted, and civil 
registration was enhanced. Despite the gravity of the 
DRC crisis, the RRRP is only 14 per cent funded, as at 
September 2018. 

The 2019-2020 Regional RRP presents the biannual 
inter-agency response to the renewed and heightened 
humanitarian challenge posed by the mounting number 
of Congolese refugees in the countries neighbouring 
the DRC, including both existing refugee populations 
and new arrivals, alongside host communities. By the 


end of 2019, at a first stage, response partners aim to 
address the needs of 1,152,000 Congolese refugees in 
seven countries of asylum (Angola, Burundi, the 
Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, the United 
Republic of Tanzania and Zambia), which have detailed 
response plans featured in separate chapters, and in 
other countries in the region where Congolese refugees 
are being hosted, which are captured in the regional 
overview. 

Response activities and interventions in refugee 
hosting areas which are impacted by the refugee crisis, 
including the communities hosting or living side by side 
with refugees, will target local populations with the aim 
to provide assistance to some 1,588,000 individuals, 
thus ensuring access for all to better quality services 
and at the same time promoting development and 
building social cohesion. For this reason, development 
interventions for strengthening resilience of refugees 
and host communities will be scaled up alongside life-
saving humanitarian assistance and protection. 

The planning figures are based on a scenario 
anticipating a deterioration of the situation within the 
DRC. In addition, contingency planning was undertaken 
in connection with the current volatile insecurity and 
socio-economic situation which could witness more 
outflows of Congolese refugees to neighbouring 
countries. In the Regional Contingency Plan for the 
DRC situation, it is estimated that in the event of a major 
emergency in the country that might occur between the 
months of August and December 2018, leading up to 
the presidential elections, and in the post-election 
period, over 386,000 new Congolese refugees and 
asylum seekers could arrive in countries of asylum. 
Further, it is estimated that some 78,000 refugees 
currently residing in the DRC might return to their 
countries of origin. In case of major refugee outflows, 
the Regional RRP will be revised. 

 

 

 

 

 THE GLOBAL COMPACT ON REFUGEES 

 

AND THE APPLICATION OF COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSES 

 

 

In 2016, all 193 Member States of the United Nations adopted the New 
York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, and the Comprehensive 
Refugee Response Framework (CRRF) as part of it, to strengthen 
international responsibility sharing in situations of large movements 
of refugees and protracted refugee situations. The New York 
Declaration set in motion preparations for the global compact on 
refugees, informed by the practical application of comprehensive 
responses and a broad range of consultations, which is set to be 
affirmed by the General Assembly by the end of-2018. 

 

With the CRRF as an integral part, the global compact on refugees 
proposes a range of global and context-specific measures for 
applying comprehensive responses in a more systematic and 
sustainable ways, as outlined in its programme of action. The 
objectives of the global compact are to: (i) ease pressures on host 
countries; (ii) enhance refugee self-reliance; (iii) expand access to 
third country solutions; and (iv) support conditions in countries of 
origin for return in safety and dignity. 

 

Regional and country-based refugee response plans contribute to the 
implementation of the global compact on refugees by articulating 
prioritized multi-stakeholder responses for the benefit refugees and 
host communities, as identified with governments and partners. 
Among countries affected by the DRC situation, Uganda, Rwanda and 
Zambia are already applying the CRRF, as of end-2018, while the 
strategy outlined in this RRRP reinforces the implementation of 
further responses in line with the global compact on refugees 
throughout all countries of its coverage in 2019.

Regional Protection and Population Needs 

 

The needs of Congolese refugees in the region remain 
significant. While most of the countries of asylum are 
maintaining open borders, refugees are facing 
challenges because of additional barriers including 
restrictions on the freedom of movement, the rights to 
work and to housing, land and property rights, access to 
education and justice, as well as discrimination and 
xenophobia. 

The current refugee settlements and camps in many 
host countries are full and the available basic services 
are stretched to the limits. Meanwhile, there is a need to 
accommodate the growing Congolese refugee 
population and organize the relocation to safe places 
away from border areas, and the establishment of new 
settlements. Creating livelihoods for refugees in rural 
hosting-areas where there are few opportunities for 
income-generating activities is crucial, as well as 
increasing vocational and skills training for refugees 
living in urban areas. 

The humanitarian situation in the region is a highly 
complex one, as illustrated by the different groups of 
refugees and internally displaced persons in those 
countries where Congolese refugees are being hosted, 
thereby aggravating the already limited capacity of host 
communities and States. Moreover, as resources have 
been decreasing there are rising concerns over food 
security and nutrition, health, the provision of other 
basic needs and minimum standards that are often not 
met. 

Refugees are especially vulnerable, specifically women 
and children, given their situation of displacement and 
therefore States, in cooperation with humanitarian and 
development actors, need to provide these categories 
of refugees with adequate protection against human 
rights abuses and give legal safeguards and livelihood 
opportunities to improve their status in the society, 
building social cohesion. The precarious situation of 
most of the countries hosting refugees highlights the 
importance of bringing humanitarian and protection 
assistance closer to development responses at all 
levels, in order to build an environment conducive to 
integration. 

In Angola, since 2013, the Government has not been 
issuing legal documents (e.g. IDs) to refugees or 
asylum-seekers. Police harassment and lack of 
understanding of refugees’ rights and responsibilities, 
both by police officers and refugees themselves, create 
vulnerabilities for the urban caseload in Luanda. 

Refugee households in Lóvua settlement, Lunda Norte, 
are facing challenges in improving their livelihoods and 
achieving self-reliance due to limited agricultural 
productivity, lack of access to income-generating 
opportunities and low purchasing power. In this 
connection, there is a need to maintain the food 
pipeline, and to also explore alternatives for 
complementing the food supply in the event of 
disruption of the food pipeline. In addition there is a big 
population of unemployed refugee youths in the Lovua 
settlement and lack of professional training / job 
opportunities resulting in all kind of risks for refugees 
and asylum-seekers, especially for women and girls. 

The trend analysis of SGBV in Lunda Norte indicated 
that an average of 25 cases are reported per month 
against refugee women and girls, while child protection 
related incidences are still rampant with between 10 – 
20 cases reported on a weekly basis, mostly related to 
neglect and physical abuse, and occasionally early 
marriages and sexual abuse. There is an increasing 
demand for formal education for children and 
adolescents, as well as for adults. Health assistance is 
provided, however, there is a shortage of qualified 
medical personnel, equipment and medicines, 
especially in Lunda Norte. Water supply is still 
problematic though more boreholes should be 
completed in 2018 easing the stuation. 

Burundi is facing a long-standing humanitarian crisis, 
which affects the protection of Congolese refugees, 
particularly in terms of security, freedom of movement, 
access to basic social services such as education, 
health and local integration, including self-reliance and 
prospects for naturalization. 

For decades the country has been experiencing a 
shortage of available land, making it difficult to start 
building new camps for refugees and in case of an 
emergency influx the capacity of existing transit centres 
and camps will need to be increased. In light of these 
likely needs, focus should be given to ensuring access 
to territory, identifying accommodation for all new 
influxes, and providing protection and multi-sectoral 
assistance to the refugees in need. 

In 2019, Burundi will be in a pre-electoral year, which 
may change public attitudes towards refugees, and 
exacerbate violations of their rights. In this connection, 
there is need to increase awareness and understanding 
aimed at combating racism and xenophobia. 

Taking into account the several consequences of the 
current multidimensional socio-political enviroment, as 
well as the lack of capacity within host communities to 
assist refugees, livelihoods opportunities need to be 
further supported as an effective alternative to the lack 
of local integration in Burundi. 

In the Republic of Congo, Congolese refugees require 
an effective response to meet their particular needs. 
Tailored assistance to people with special needs is 
important, including for women at risk, elderly people, 
single parents, separated and unaccompanied children, 
people with disabilities, survivors of sexual and gender-
based violence as well as people with severe medical 
conditions. In addition, the care of people living with 
mental disabilities remains a challenge due to lack of 
structures and specialized staff. 


Children are victims of many harmful practices such as 
labour, exploitation, sexual and gender-based violence 
including child marriage. In this context, there is a high 
percentage of children at risk in the population that 
require continuous attention. Most common forms of 
reported sexual and gender-based violence are early 
marriage, rape, physical abuse, sexual assault, 
psychological abuse, denial of resources and family 
abandonment. 

Case identification and reporting remains a challenge 
due to cultural barriers and the lack of judicial sanctions 
for perpetrators of violence who benefit from out-of-
court settlements or victims' refusal to prosecute in most 
cases. The legal response to acts of sexual and gender-
based violence remains a huge challenge in the area. 
Efforts will be also made to establish synergies with 
local judicial authorities and the police to set up a 
complaints mechanism, and increase awareness of 
victims on the possibility of lodging complaints against 
the perpetrators. 

In Rwanda, land scarcity remains a challenge to 
promote livelihood activities. While refugees enjoy a 
generally favourable protection environment, the poor 
situation of the refugee camps and lack of livelihood 
opportunities mean that most refugees are still highly 
dependent on humanitarian assistance to meet their 
basic needs like shelter, WASH, food, health, 
education, nutrition and energy for cooking. 

Due to lack of funding, food rations were cut numerous 
times in the past and if the funding level does not 
increase in 2019 and 2020, additional cuts / reductions 
will occur and may result in turmoil as happened in 
Kiziba camp in February 2018, with fatal repercussions. 

Refugees who are registered in camp locations face 
risks of arrest and detention if they move outside the 
camp without the requisite documents such as refugee 
IDs or proof of registration, and a letter proving that their 
absence from the camp was authorized. Thus, there is 
need for legal assistance and detention monitoring, as 
well as advocacy for greater freedom of movement of 
camp-based refugees. 

Challenges and concern continue to exist for children at 
risk, care arrangements for unaccompanied children, 
family reunification, and limited friendly spaces for 
children and youth. Further, SGBV is identified as one 
of the biggest protection concerns for refugee women 
and children in refugee settings in Rwanda. 

While refugee children who are residing in camps 
continue to be enrolled in national schools, most of the 
schools lack necessary infrastructure, teachers and 
supplies. All urban refugee children have the right to be 
enrolled in different national schools in and out of Kigali. 

With the ongoing Ebola virus disease outbreak in North 
Kivu and Ituri Provinces of DRC, the risk of spill over to 
Rwanda and other neighbouring countries is high. 
Strengthening the epidemic preparedness and 
response at the different transit/reception centres and 
camps, including medical screening, appropriate health 
staff trainings, prepositioning of equipment and supplies 
and community surveillance is extremely necessary. 

As most of the shelters in Congolese camps are very 
old and camps are congested with no proper access 
roads or fire break points, focus should be given to 
establishing better site layouts and re-arranging the 
camp as some of the shelters are situated in high risk 
areas and need to be relocated to safer zones. 

Supply of water is below 15 litres/person/day in 
Nyabiheke and Kigeme camps and with this major 
challenge, advocacy efforts and investments are 
needed to upgrade and improve the reliability of water 
supply systems through increasing the quantity of water 
production. Meanwhile, most of the access ways to 
sanitation facilities should be adapted for people with 
disabilities. 

In Uganda, Despite Uganda’s favourable protection 
environment, refugees are faced with numerous 
protection challenges due to the magnitude of 
displacement and growing vulnerabilities, compounded 
by diminishing resources and strained social services in 
refugee-hosting districts. 

Among the most vulnerable populations are 
unaccompanied and separated children, women, 
adolescents, older persons at risk, persons with 
disabilities and serious medical conditions, and persons 
suffering from trauma. For SGBV incidents that 
occurred before or during flight, survivors have little or 
no chance to effectively pursue legal redress. Emotional 
and psychological trauma is common among refugees 
who have experienced violence or have witnessed 
violence perpetrated against family or community 
members. Community outreach and mobilization need 
to be further strengthened so as to enable communities 
to effectively play an active role in their own protection. 
Furthermore, twenty-five per cent of the population 
constitute women of reproductive age, requiring 
availability and accessibility of sexual and reproductive 
health services and sexual and gender-based violence 
(SGBV) services. 

Tensions exist between the host communities, long-
term refugees and new arrivals due to competition over 
decreasing resources (mainly firewood, water, land) 
and the real or perceived belief of unequal access to 
services. However, refugees face significant challenges 
in accessing justice, especially in remote areas where 
the presence of the judiciary and police is limited or non-
existent. 

There are concerns that combatants from various 
armed groups may enter Uganda in refugee flows, 
compromising the civilian character of asylum and 
refugee settlements and potentially leading to incidents 
of forced recruitment, child abuse, SGBV and inter-
communal tensions. Existing policies and practices on 
separation, internment, demobilization and 
rehabilitation of former combatants need to be further 
strengthened. 

Currently, 53 percent of the primary-aged and 92 
percent of the secondary-aged children are out of 


school, and an average of 22 percent are enrolled in 
grades lower than expected for their age. Early 
marriage and pregnancy lead to girls dropping out of 
school, unlikely to ever return. Low enrolment and 
attendance, and high dropout rates among children and 
the youth can be attributed to language barriers. 

Refugees and hosts are mostly dependent on natural 
resources to meet their basic needs for cooking energy, 
materials for shelter and agricultural land. Some also 
generate income by selling biomass and non-wood 
forest products. 

While reforestation and afforestation efforts are 
underway, dedicated woodlots for fuel and agroforestry 
interventions are needed in all settlements at a much 
larger scale, including deliberate planning for 
management of planted trees for at least a year to 
improve survival rates. Access to sustainable energy for 
sufficient and clean cooking, lighting and power remain 
key challenges in the refugee settlements and in 
Uganda at large. 

Almost the majority of refugee populations in Uganda 
are receiving food assistance in the settlements either 
in-kind or through cash transfers. There is a need to 
standardize general food assistance across the refugee 
response in Uganda and increasingly roll out cash-
based transfers for both general food assistance and 
livelihood and food-for-assets interventions. 

In view of achieving provision of integrated health 
services and equitable access for both refugee and host 
communities, there is an urgent need to strengthen the 
health care system at national, district and local levels 
through investments and measures that enhance the 
capacity to respond to current needs and future shocks. 
More efforts are needed to enhance targeted 
supplementary feeding programme, skills training for 
health workers in Infant and Young Child Feeding 
practices in emergencies and expand the use of a newly 
introduced vaccine in the routine immunization. 
Preventive approaches to address acute malnutrition 
and micronutrient deficiencies are needed to 
complement the existing curative measures. 

To stabilize livelihoods and overcome the socio-
economic empowerment disconnect, geographic and 
population differences need to be considered in the 
provision of livelihood support. When exploring different 
livelihood strategies, key factors linked to productive 
assets, knowledge, skills and aspirations need to further 
be considered as linkages to markets and income – 
generating opportunities. 

In order to facilitate the smooth relocation of new 
refugee arrivals from border entry points through to 
household shelter plots, the existing transit and 
reception centres will need ongoing construction and 
maintenance, repairs, potential expansion and 
installation of energy-saving stoves. The allocation of 
productive land for agriculture is essential to promote 
incomes and self-sustaining food security. To ensure a 
harmonised approach, any new settlement should be 
planned and mapped in accordance with the same land 
use management principles. 

There is a complete lack of integrated water resource 
management, with developments in the settlements 
often failing to consider the larger catchment area for 
planning and programming. The environment is heavily 
impacted by over-reliance on groundwater without 
monitoring behaviour of benevolent aquifers in most 
refugee-hosting districts, absence of deliberate 
catchment conservation and rehabilitation initiatives. 
There is a need to harmonize approaches in the 
implementation of WASH programmes in the 
settlements and refugee-hosting districts. 

In Tanzania the closure of all border entry points across 
north western Tanzania has made access to territory 
more difficult. New administrative instructions further 
restricting refugees’ movement both inside and outside 
the camps have also severely limited refugees’ coping 
mechanisms, while at the same time the high rejection 
rate of refugee claims exposes many asylum seekers to 
a variety of protection risks. 

A lack of official identity documents for refugees has 
also made it difficult for refugees to access basic 
services. Delays in resolving registration issues 
continue to negatively undermine current protection 
initiatives. Persons with specific needs (PSNs) in 
Nyarugusu camp continue to receive targeted 
assistance and support, however, the population keeps 
facing many challenges, including discrimination, 
marginalization, stigmatization as well as limited 
capacity to access essential services. 

Refugee children face serious protection risks such as 
separation from families, psychosocial distress, abuse 
and exploitation, including child labour and sexual 
exploitation. Limited educational opportunities, 
vocational skills training and job opportunities are 
serious gaps, which may lead to several protection risks 
as well as negative coping mechanisms such as drug 
abuse and transactional and survival sex. 

Intimate partner violence remains as the highest 
category in all refugee camps in the country, and more 
refugee women than men experience violence at home, 
making this a significant safety concern. 

Tanzania’s refugee policy supports the principle of 
education for repatriation and the country of origin 
curriculum is taught in all schools in the camps. 
However, the lack of qualified special education 
teachers as well as learning and reference materials 
means that children with learning difficulties have to 
attend regular schools and do not get the special 
attention that they need. The encampment policy also 
restricts children with special education needs from 
accessing public schools which cater to their needs 
outside the camps. 

While water supply networks are also more reliable and 
efficient, following the drilling of additional boreholes 
and several backup pumps and installation of solar-
powered pumping systems, major gaps in sanitation 
and hygiene persist. 


More than 50% of refugees and asylum-seekers in the 
three camps continue to live in dilapidated emergency 
shelters and tents for extended periods of time leading 
to unacceptable living conditions. A lack of transitional 
shelters with adapted WASH facilities for PSNs is 
another challenge. In addition, strengthening the 
delivery of essential services such as adequate health 
care, physical and psychosocial support, material 
assistance and referrals through community structures 
and services is needed. 

Community and household surveillance assessments 
have indicated a stable food consumption score but at 
the same time a significant increase in the coping 
strategy index, which means that households are at risk 
of further deterioration in food security status unless 
there are improvements in ration entitlements. 

In Zambia, reception facilities along the various border 
entry points, as well as those in refugee settlements and 
in urban areas including Lusaka, barely meet the 
minimum reception conditions and standards that 
address basic and psychosocial needs for new arrivals 
in a dignified manner. Overcrowding and provision of 
basic services such as water supply and sanitation are 
in need of urgent maintenance and upgrading. 

Populations with specific needs including 
unaccompanied children, SGBV survivors, persons 
living with disabilities and the elderly require a more 
complex, comprehensive national response. However, 
given the limited resources and institutional capacity to 
comprehensively address the needs of vulnerable 
population groups, coupled with the lack of safety social 
nets, which refugees may rely upon, serious protection 
challenges persist for these groups. 

Zambia’s encampment policy remains one of the major 
protection challenges. Restriction on freedom of 
movement is the primary concern and source of 
discontentment among the refugee population as it 
limits their access to essential goods, sources of 
income, access to education and access to social 
services, including health and higher education. As a 
result of the limitation imposed on freedom of 
movement, many refugees reside in urban areas 
without authorization, exposing them to a number of 
risks, including detention. 

Zambia has supported the local integration of long-
staying refugees, however, this needs to be promoted 
further, including with improvement of infrastructure and 
provision of services in the refugee-hosting areas. The 
road networks in all three settlements require 
construction, repair or upgrading, so as to facilitate 
access and mobility to and fro, as well as service- 
delivery to the settlements. Similarily, access to energy 
and connectivity will be key to the development of the 
settlements, supporting livelihood opportunities in those 
areas and eventually, creating a favourable protection 
environment for refugees and host communities. 

The Southern Africa region (excluding Angola and 
Zambia) hosts over 104,000 refugees from the DRC, 
mainly in South Africa (58,774), Malawi (21,764), 
Mozambique (10,476) and Zimbabwe (9,590) but also 
in Namibia (3,050), Botswana (307), the Kingdom of 
eSwatini (561), Lesotho (55) and Madagascar (10), as 
at August 2018. Congolese refugees are arriving in 
Southern Africa as part of mixed migratory flows 
crossing several countries before formally seeking 
asylum. The increasing number of refugees and asylum 
seekers from the DRC leads to constrains faced by local 
authorities to provide protection and assistance to new 
arrivals. Many Congolese experience difficulties in 
accessing asylum procedures or obtaining 
documentation. Some have been detained for lengthy 
periods. Women and unaccompanied children are 
particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse, 
including sexual and gender based violence (SGBV). In 
South Africa, refugees and asylum seekers are mainly 
hosted in camps or settlements. Despite some 
successful livelihood interventions in the region, most 
Congolese refugees depend on assistance and 
services provided by humanitarian and development 
actors. 

Congolese refugees and asylum seekers are hosted in 
other countries in Africa, such as in Kenya (40,214), 
the Central African Republic (1,787), South Sudan 
(15,461) and Chad (292). The Kenyan Government 
remains welcoming vis-à-vis the Congolese asylum-
seekers despite Kenya not sharing a border with DRC. 
However, Congolese do not enjoy prima facie status 
and have to undergo individual RSD. The Central 
African Republic (CAR) hosts a protracted caseload of 
Congolese refugees. Congolese refugees and asylum 
seekers enjoy a prima facie status. In cooperation with 
the Government of CAR, the focus of the response is on 
the search for durable solutions, notably local 
integration since the majority of refugees are not 
interested in voluntary repatriation. Pending refugees’ 
effective empowerment, multi-sectorial assistance 
(housing, food, education and health) will continue to be 
provided, especially to the most vulnerable. In South 
Sudan the response focus on lifesaving emergency 
activities as well as stabilisation of the existing refugee 
population. In spite of periodic protection monitoring, 
lootings and sexual assaults are still among the major 
protection incidents in refugee-hosting areas. 

 

 

 


Regional Response Strategy and Priorities 

Regional Protection Framework 

The activitites described in the 2019-2020 Regional 
RRP aim to provide protection and multi-sectoral 
assistance, and to increase the focus on building the 
self-reliance and resilience of refugees. Congolese 
refugees in Angola, Burundi, the Republic of Congo, 
Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia will benefit 
from a series of specific interventions. These 
interventions will also benefit other refugee populations 
in the same hosting-areas as Congolese refugees, and 
local communities in these countries. Preparedness 
activities will continue in other countries receiving 
Congolese refugees such as CAR, Chad, Kenya and 
South Sudan, and countries in Southern Africa which 
are experiencing secondary movements. 

The overarching regional response strategy aims at 
protecting the rights of people of concern within a cross-
border framework, responding to continued and sudden 
population displacement. The immediate needs of new 
arrivals will continue to be addressed, while long-term 
solutions and improved opportunities will be developed 
and implemented to empower communities and strive 
for solutions to the refugee crisis. 

Advocacy for the inclusion of refugees in national 
development plans and labour markets will continue. 
Support will be provided to host governments regarding 
voluntary repatriation, ensuring that returnees receive 
humanitarian assistance in zones of return. Response 
activities will support the objectives of the global 
compact on refugees with the Comprehensive Refugee 
Response Framework (CRRF) as part of it. In countries 
where the application of the CRRF has not yet been 
initiated, efforts will be made so that a strong protection 
and solutions framework is developed and initiated in 
line with the objectives of the global compact on 
refugees. 

The response plan will be guided by the following 
strategic objectives: 

Strategic 
Objective 
1. 

Preserve equal and unhindered access 
to territorial asylum and international 
protection, promoting the full 
enjoyment of rights, and the civilian 
character of asylum. 



Advocacy with governments will continue towards 
ensuring the civilian character of asylum to allow for 
safe access to territory for asylum seekers and 
promoting prima facie recognition of refugee status, 
based on the 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1969 
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Convention 
governing the specific aspects of refugee problems in 
Africa. 

Against this objective, and to ensure dignified treatment 
of persons in need of international protection, RRRP 
partners will work together with governments and 
national authorities to bolster relevant mechanisms for 
effective border and protection monitoring. This will 
entail sensitization of security forces and border officials 
on key international protection and human rights 
standards and obligations, such as the principles of 
non-refoulement and the best interests of the child. 

Response partners will work to support governments in 
the region, in ensuring that national law and policies are 
applied consistently in line with international standards 
and regional cooperation frameworks relating to 
refugees, returnees, and internally displaced persons 
and preventing statelessness, such as the 2009 
Kampala Convention for the Protection and Assistance 
of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa and the 1954 
and 1961 Conventions on Statelessness. 

With a view to strengthening the protection environment 
in countries of asylum, response partners together with 
respective governments and national authorities, will 
seek to improve and empower reception capacities, 
including by increasing the number of Refugee Status 
Determination (RSD) facilities. Verification of new 
arrivals and biometric registration will be further 
enhanced. The issuance of refugee identity cards, to 
enable refugees to enjoy the right to free movement and 
to have access to quality services and livelihood 
opportunities will also enhanced. Given the large 
number of children and specific risks and vulnerabilities 
of this population, birth registration and specialized child 
protection systems and programmes will be 
strengthened. 

Strategic 
Objective 
2. 

Support all efforts to maintain the 
civilian and humanitarian character of 
refugee camps and settlements. 



To ensure that refugee camps and settlements maintain 
their civilian and humanitarian character, response 
partners will work closely with the relevant national 
authorities to provide an effective protective 
environment for those in need of international 
protection. 

Advocacy and awareness-raising campaigns will be 
carried out for refugees and other people of concern in 
refugee hosting-areas, as well as for the host 
communities, regarding the importance of maintaining 
the civilian and humanitarian character of displacement 
sites and to prevent incidents of sexual and gender 
based violence (SGBV) and forced child recruitment. 

RRRP partners will continue the identification and 
registration of persons with specific needs, advocating 
for specific attention to children and women who have 
been associated with armed forces or armed groups, as 
well as for the identification and separation of armed 
elements. 


Civil-military cooperation will be further promoted, 
including through engagement in protection dialogues, 
ensuring appropriate distinctions between the roles of 
humanitarian actors and security forces. Capacity 
building for military and police personnel, and camp-
based security staff, will continue so that the physical 
safety of displaced populations is secured in camps and 
settlements. 

Strategic 
Objective 
3. 

Achieve minimum standards in the 
provision of multi-sectoral assistance 
to refugees and host communities with 
a view to anchor the response in 
government systems; development 
plans; multi-year strategies; and 
regional protection frameworks and 
policies – paying particular attention to 
the needs of children, youth and 
women. 



RRRP partners in cooperation with the respective 
national authorities, will continue to provide multi-
sectoral assistance to refugees and host communities, 
ensuring access to basic, essential services including to 
address food in security, health, nutrition, shelter, 
WASH and education. 

With a view to integrate refugee responses into national 
protection and development plans, and in line with 
regional protection frameworks and policies, efforts will 
be focused on improving the management of population 
movements, and infrastructure development that would 
reinforce community resilience in refugee-hosting 
areas. This will include enhancing community-based 
mechanisms and promoting participation of people of 
concern in developing and implementing area-based 
interventions, interdisciplinary and inter-organizational 
cooperation, and collaboration and coordination.

Particular attention will be paid to identifying and 
assisting children, the youth and women, usually the 
most vulnerable category of persons in displacement 
settings, and persons with specific needs living in 
refugee sites and host communities. Child protection 
will be enhanced, including through monitoring and 
referral to services to address cases of grave violations 
that may have occurred in the country of origin, or during 
flight. In preventing and responding to sexual and 
gender-based violence (SGBV), the protection strategy 
will promote a range of approaches enhancing the 
capacities of people of concern and their communities 
in raising awareness about SGBV and ensuring access 
to justice. 

Response partners will seek to ensure access to quality 
education for all school-aged refugee children and 
promote the integration of education for refugees into 
national education systems. The learning environment 
will be improved through the construction and 
rehabilitation of infrastructure and the provision of 
equipment and as learning materials. Wherever 
feasible, innovative forms of teaching with the use of 


technology will be developed. Awareness-raising 
campaigns will be conducted to promote the importance 
of education for children, and training programmes for 
adolescents and adults in safe learning environments, 
which will enable them to be better equipped to engage 
in income generating activities. 

Advocacy efforts are designed to ensure that primary 
health care, including sexual and reproductive health 
and health care for SGBV survivors are integrated into 
national and local systems. Medical services for all 
persons of concern will be maintained and improved, 
prioritizing construction and rehabilitation of health 
facilities in camps and the surrounding areas, while 
health workers will receive training in the provision of 
quality standard care. 

Dedicated efforts will be prioritized to ensure that the 
required response is provided to enhance the nutritional 
status of refugees and host populations, and above all 
for children, and pregnant and lactating women. 

Interventions aimed at enhancing refugee contributions 
to their own food consumption and promoting nutrition 
education and capacity building for food security will 
help to address food insecurity and support dietary 
diversity. RRRP partners will pursue in-kind 
distributions of unconditional and conditional food 
assistance. 

Shelter assistance, through either cash transfers or in-
kind assistance, will strengthen shelter structures. Basic 
infrastructures will be improved in refugee settlements 
and refugee-hosting areas. 

Water and sanitation facilities will be rehabilitated or 
constructed with particular emphasis on separated 
toilets for males and females, ensuring gender-sensitive 
WASH interventions and access for persons with 
specific needs. Preventive campaigns against 
communicable and parasitic diseases will be 
implemented. 

Strategic 
Objective 
4. 

Promote social cohesion and peaceful 
co-existence between refugees and 
host communities through the 
implementation of targeted self-
reliance and resilience programmes 
and respect for the natural 
environment. 



Response partners will strengthen efforts to achieve 
peaceful coexistence and social cohesion within 
refugee communities and between refugees and host 
communities. These efforts will aim to achieve the 
integration of services and facilities, including aligning 
services in the camps with those already existing in the 
surrounding communities. 

RRRP partners will to promote peacebuilding initiatives, 
alongside other humanitarian and development 
interventions in refugee-hosting areas in such a way 
that encourages opportunities, for refugees and local 
populations to engage with each other, building positive 
encounters and ensuring self-reliance and 
independence. 

Due to the relatively limited infrastructure in many 
refugee hosting areas, public services and institutions 
will be supported with development, resilience and self-
reliance activities. These will include better managenent 
of the environment and raising risk awareness as well 
as the mitigation of risks to damage the environment. 
Training programmes in sustainable farming, fishing, 
non-farming income generation, small-scale trading and 
enhanced agricultural productivity, will help improve 
access to markets. 

To prevent tensions and conflict between refugees and 
host communities related to the use of land, partners will 
increase awareness-raising and campaigns on 
environmental protection, to contribute to minimizing 
environmental degradation resulting from the presence 
of refugees. Wherever possible, activities will include 
plant production, use of energy-saving stoves, solid 
waste recycling/re-use, and distribution of alternatives 
to wood. 

Strategic 
Objective 
5. 

Foster economic self-reliance and 
durable solutions for refugees, and 
host communities, by expanding the 
use of cash assistance, reducing the 
dependency on humanitarian aid and 
promoting socio-economic growth in 
line with national and development 
plans. 



RRRP partners will seek to foster the economic self-
reliance of refugees, including through sustainable 
livelihood opportunities with a view to enabling long 
term solutions. Refugees will help contribute to the 
development of their host countries and be in a better 
position to make meaningful contributions when they 
return to their country of origin. Freedom of movement 
and the right to work will be key elements to implement 
such plans to ensure that refugees enjoy their basic 
rights. 

In line with this objective, response partners will identify 
more opportunities to strengthen and increase the use 
of cash-based interventions (CBIs), to allow people of 
concern to meet their purchasing needs in a dignified 
manner, thus, reducing dependency on humanitarian 
aid. 

Together with host governments, humanitarian and 
development partners will seek to promote the socio-
economic local integration of refugees, aligned with 
national development plans, the “multi-stakeholder” 
approach embedded within the CRRF, and based on 
the commitments made by UN Member States in New 
York and in keeping with the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs). 

Response partners will continue to conduct joint 
assessments and analysis in line with the “New Way of 
Working” to understand the challenges on the ground, 
and identify priority projects, actions and sectors for 
interventions. 


Investment will be geared towards host communities 
whenever possible, as agents of protection and 
development plans will be established based on an 
economic understanding of the refugee-hosting areas 
and local market conditions. 

RRRP partners will support voluntary repatriation, the 
implementation of local integration strategy in the 
countries of asylum and resettlement to third countries. 
In this connection, governments will be supported in 
ensuring that refugee returns are voluntary, safe, 
carried out in conditions of dignity, and based on well-
informed decisions and that facilitated returns are within 
the framework of tripartite agreements and respect the 
principle of non-refoulement. 

 

 

Strengthening Livelihoods and Resilience 

 

Achievements will aim to strengthen livelihoods and the resilience of Congolese refugees and other people of 
concern in refugee-hosting areas, through an integrated approach. By expanding access to livelihoods and 
increasing job opportunities, refugees will be able to live active, productive and dignified lives, which will 
eventually eliminate dependence on humanitarian aid. This will contribute to economic growth and will foster 
the development of refugee-hosting areas and areas of return in the country of origin. 

Through the resilience-based strategy, refugees will have more opportunities for entrepreneurship and access 
to good-quality financial services, to enable them to recover from the negative consequences of forced 
displacement, in particular, those in protracted situations. In many countries of asylum in the region, refugees 
are already successful entrepreneurs and offer services to host communities. 

The strategy will focus on supporting national systems and local communities in strengthening the response 
capacity to displacement. The implementation of legal frameworks will help with better access to employment 
and expanding the potential of local integration. Efforts to strengthen livelihoods and self-reliance will aim at 
equipping and preparing those in forced displacement to respond to the protection risks they face, and 
engaging host communities to promote social cohesion and peaceful co-existence. 

Within the context of this regional response plan, partners will carry out resilience interventions in Uganda 
focusing on supporting national systems to achieve integrated social service delivery for both refugees and 
host communities. In Angola, strengthening of livelihoods will be closely linked to addressing food insecurity 
in the areas of enhancing food availability (through increased production) and access to land for agriculture 
production (with emphasis on income and markets). In the Republic of Congo, response partners will maintain 
support to the local population through health, water and education projects to promote peaceful coexistence 
between refugees and the local populations, and build the resilience of host communities. 

In Rwanda, focus will be given to the implementation of market-based livelihoods interventions both in the areas 
of farming and business, and creating more wage employment. In Tanzania, more long-term projects with broad-
based benefits will be promoted to help build the resilience of both refugees and host communities, 
strengthening the refugee protection in case new influxes occur. In Zambia, interventions will seek to extend 
and increase livelihoods support for quick impact projects (e.g. group entrepreneurship, bricklaying machines), 
rain-fed farming, vocational and technical skills training and construction of market structures. 

To achieve this, RRRP partners will work closely with governments and development partners to establish 
synergies, aiming to enhance refugee inclusion in national and local development plans/policies. As a first step, 
UNHCR and UNDP are working together to develop and implement joined up humanitarian-development-peace 
interventions to deliver predictable refugee and host community responses in the immediate, medium and long 
term. The joint programming intends to address humanitarian and development challenges that affect the 
resilience and integration of refugees in countries of asylum. Building on each organisation’s comparative 
advantages to produce a complementary combination of humanitarian and development interventions that 
empower refugees, as well as to support host communities and governments to better cope with providing 
asylum to refugees, strengthen their resilience and harness their capacities towards achieving sustainable 
development. A key requirement is to start the process of identifying other potential partners to achieve a 
holistic approach to humanitarian and development needs. 

 


Planning Assumptions 

1. The presence of various non-state actors in the 
eastern region of the DRC will continue, as will 
intercommunal fighting, with varied degrees of 
intensity, in the provinces of Ituri, North Kivu, South 
Kivu, Maniema and Tanganyika, and in the Kasai 
region, as well as in other areas in the country. 
Under these dynamics, the risk of further population 
displacement within the DRC is high, which will 
eventually result in outflows of refugees to 
neighbouring countries. 
2. The Congolese political arena is dominated by the 
ongoing electoral process. It is likely that public 
demonstrations, protests and uprisings will occur 
during the period leading up to the presidential 
elections, scheduled for 23 December 2018, and 
the months after. Insecurity may become more 
widespread, affecting urban areas in particular and 
leading to further displacement inside and out of the 
DRC. 
3. New arrivals in neighbouring countries will vary from 
100 to over 1,000 Congolese asylum-seekers 
crossing borders per week. At the same time, some 
Congolese refugees may choose to return to the 
DRC. However, it is difficult to predict the number of 
possible returns of refugees due to the current 
political and socio-economic uncertainties. 
4. By the end of 2019, the projected cumulative 
number of Congolese refugees fleeing violence in 
the DRC may reach close to 1,152,000, out of 
whom an estimated 211,000 will be new refugees. 
In addition, it is estimated that during 2020 over 
70,000 new refugees from the DRC could arrive in 
countries of asylum, bringing the total number of 
Congolese refugees in the region to around 
1,223,000, by the end of 2020. 
5. Borders will remain open to refugees seeking 
protection in neighbouring countries. 


 

Coordination 

Under the Refugee Coordination Model (RCM), UNHCR 
leads and coordinates the response to the DRC refugee 
emergency, in close collaboration and consultation with 
relevant government counterparts in countries of 
asylum in the region, ensuring that the response is 
coherent with developments within the DRC. 

The response is supported by UN Country Teams and 
other humanitarian and developments partners, as well 
as civil society in the region. 

 

 

 

UNHCR appointed a Regional Refugee Coordinator 
(RRC) for the DRC situation, covering Congolese 
refugees in Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, 
Rwanda, Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, the 
United Republic of Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and 
other countries receiving refugees from the DRC. 

The RRC is responsible for coordinating the response 
for Congolese refugees and other people of concern 
receiving humanitarian and development assistance, 
including returnees and the impacted host communities. 

The RRC ensures an overarching vision and coherent 
engagement across the region in pursuit of protection 
and solutions. The “All of society” approach will 
guarantee a more comprehensive response that takes 
into account the needs of host populations and assists 
in building the foundations for long term solutions to the 
refugee situation, as well as in strengthening livelihoods 
and resilience. The approach recognizes and builds on 
capacities of refugees, host communities and the 
national institutions and local systems that support them 
to anticipate, prevent, absorb and recover from crises, 
while continuing to function and adapt in a way that 
supports longer-term prospects for sustainable 
development, peace and security, and the attainment of 
human rights. 

The RRC will broaden the scope of partnerships to 
mobilize resources and increase visibility for the needs 
of Congolese refugees and their host communities. The 
global Compact on tefugees, , the 2030 Sustainable 
Development Agenda and the principle of "Leaving No 
One Behind", provide an important framework for 
collaboration with partners, including national and 
bilateral actors, as well as international and multilateral 
humanitarian, development and peacebuilding 
organizations. Private sector engagement will also be 
critical to ensure sustainable solutions. 

The RRC for the DRC situation will pay particular 
attention to building constructive linkages with regional 
bodies, including the African Union (AU), the Common 
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the 
International Conference on the Great Lakes Region 
(ICGLR), the Intergovernmental Authority on 
Development (IGAD), and the Southern African 
Development Community (SADC), as well as with the 
office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary General for 
the Great Lakes Region and other UN agencies, 
humanitarian and development actors.

Background and Achievements 

 

Overview 

 

The outbreak of violence in the Kasai region of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in March 
2017 triggered the internal displacement of some 1.4 
million persons and the flight of over 35,000 refugees 
into the north-eastern province of Lunda Norte. As State 
Party to the 1951 Refugee Convention and the OAU 
1969 Convention, Angola officially has an open-door 
policy to welcome Congolese nationals fleeing as a 
result of conflict. 

As of October 2018, the context of the response in 
Lunda Norte is as follows: 36,1072 refugees have been 
registered biometrically; out of those refugees, 22,688 
receive assistance on a monthly basis. Of these, 15,800 
refugees (3,424 families) are residing in newly 
developed settlement of Lóvua, 95 km west of the 
provincial capital, Dundo, while the remaining are still 
hosted in and around Dundo town. The Lóvua 
municipality, only three years old and with a total 
population of 12,300, has been significantly impacted by 
hosting an increasing number of Congolese refugees. 
The new municipality requires support in enhancing its 
administrative capacity to provide basic public services 
and to prepare a refugee-inclusive development plan 
benefiting both local residents and refugees. Increased 
livelihood opportunities are needed while promoting 
social cohesion and co-existence. As the situation 
remains volatile in the Kasai region with rising numbers 
of internally displaced people, voluntary repatriation of 
Congolese refugees is not currently promoted. RRRP 
partners continue to provide comprehensive support 
under the leadership of the national and provincial 
governments. 

2 Data from UNHCR Biometric Registration Update as of 22 October, 
2018 

3 Following a presidential directive on 25 September, over 350,000 
irregular immigrants were rounded up and expelled from Angola. 
Although Operacao Transparencia did not target refugees, it created 
fear among refugee communities in Lunda Norte. Therefore, numbers 
of refugees willing to relocate to Lovua increased. Relocation is 
ongoing. 

 

In addition to the situation of refugees in Lunda Norte, 
Angola hosts approximately 30,000 asylum seekers and 
15,000 refugees in Luanda, coming from DRC, Somalia, 
Eritrea, Cote d’Ivoire, Sudan, Guinea, Mauritania and 
other countries. The non-implementation of the 2015 
Asylum Law in Angola creates several problems for 
these asylum seekers and refugees, such as arbitrary 
detention, lack of access to public services including 
health and education, limits on their ability to engage in 
business ventures, and vulnerability to sexual and 
gender based violence (SGBV). UNHCR has been 
working with GOA on a registration exercise to issue 
documentation to those who have not been previously 
registered biometrically and whose documents are 
expiring. Although the Asylum Law has not been fully 
implemented, on 25 July 2018, regulations for the 
establishment of a national refugee commission (CNR) 
were approved. Regulations for establishment of 
reception centres (CARRA) were also approved on 3 
September 2018. 

Some of the challenges faced by partners include: 

. Lack of implementation of 2015 asylum Law and lack 
of reliable refugee documentation as a result; 
. Settlement policy in Lunda Norte, which in the 
absence of reliable documentation limits freedom of 
movement and thus makes it difficult for refugees to 
explore alternative livelihood options and to integrate 
into local communities; 
. Heightened uncertainty following a crackdown on 
irregular migrants and other nationals within Lunda 
Norte province3; 
. High cost of delivering assistance due to prevailing 
market conditions in Lunda Norte, long distances for 
supplies, and the remote nature of the province and 
settlement; 
. Devaluation of local currency (Angolan kwanza); 
. Insufficient market to ensure quick product 
procurement; 
. Shortage of funding which has seriously hampered 
assistance to refugees at times 


Inter-agency mechanism: going forward 

RRRP partners have been working together to ensure 
protection, build resilience among refugee communities; 
promote dialogue and positive interactions between the 
refugee community and the host community as well as 
government representatives; and support durable 
solutions for refugees. 

For the regional response in 2019 and 2020, the 
following should be prioritised: 

. Transition from emergency to development 
approaches; 
. Strengthen refugees and host communities’ 
leadership structures; 
. Support refugees and host communities on 
livelihood related activities.

The regional response for Congolese refugees will 
benefit members of the host population, as well as 
Congolese refugees and asylum seekers who are not in 
Lunda Norte province.

Needs and Vulnerabilities 

RRRP partners have identified that Congolese refugees 
and affected host populations are in need of: 

. Access to territory for asylum-seekers and 
refugees; 
. Updated documentation: since 2015, Government 
of Angola has not been issuing documents to 
refugees or asylum-seekers; 
. Awareness-raising sessions and open dialogues on 
SGBV issues with refugee communities, including 
leaders, committees, men, women, boys, girls, as 
well as local authorities; 
. Economic self-reliance: Lack of professional 
training / job opportunities results in risks for 
refugees and asylum-seekers, especially for 
women and girls; 
. Education for children and adolescents (pre-school, 
primary school, secondary school) and for adults 
(literacy and university); 
. Healthcare (especially secondary health care): 
there is a shortage of qualified medical personnel, 
equipment and medicines, especially in Lunda 
Norte; 
. Up to 96 per cent of refugees within Lovua 
Settlement rely solely on general food distribution to 
meet their daily nutritional needs4; there is therefore 
a need to maintain the food pipeline, and to also 
explore alternatives for complementing the food 
supply in the event of food pipeline disruption; 
. Findings from the UNHCR/WFP Joint Assessment 
Mission (JAM) undertaken in May 2018 highlights 
challenges faced by refugee households in Lóvua 
in improving their livelihoods and achieving self-
reliance due to limited agricultural productivity, lack 
of access to income-generating opportunities and 
low purchasing power; 
. Maintenance and upkeep of the sanitation and 
hygiene structures and the boreholes and water 


4 World Vision Post Distribution Monitoring Report, July 2018 

5 World Vision & UNHCR Market Survey Report, January 2018 

distribution system once boreholes are fully 
operational; 
. Market access for the refugee population within the 
Lovua settlement5, which will enable the 
diversification of livelihoods, reduce negative 
coping mechanisms, enhance food security, and 
promote refugee-host community relations; 
. Enhanced awareness campaigns on the rights (and 
obligations) of refugees targeted by law 
enforcement authorities. 
. Child protection related incidences are still rampant 
within the Lovua settlement with between 10 – 20 
cases reported on a weekly basis. Most of the 
incidences are related to neglect and physical 
abuse, and occasionally early marriages and sexual 
abuse; 
. The trend analysis of SGBV in Lunda Norte 
indicated that an average of 25 cases are reported 
per month against refugee women and girls; there 
is need to intensify awareness and law enforcement 
to provide a safer environment for this group; 
. There is a big population of unemployed refugee 
youth within the Lovua settlement; they are prone to 
get involved in illegal activities within and outside 
the camp (including illegal diamond mining). 
. The urban population in Angola has been facing 
challenges due to the lack of documentation or 
outdated documentation. Police harassment and 
lack of understanding of refugees’ rights and 
responsibilities, both by police officers and 
refugees, create vulnerabilities for the urban 
caseload. 


 

Host communities 

The host community has forfeited huge tracts of forest 
for the settlement of the refugee community; this land 
was previously used for gathering honey, caterpillars, 
wild game, vegetables, farming, and for fetching water. 


A recent 3L - Look, Listen, and Learn - assessment 
indicated that the situation in some of the refugee 
hosting villages may actually be worse than within the 
refugee settlement. This enhances a possibility of 
growing resentment among the refugee hosting 
population, which could fuel conflict if not addressed. 

Some of the host community members are benefiting 
from services offered by agencies in the settlement. 
Medical and water service provision, for instance, are 
reaching villages in close proximity to the settlement, 
while a market due to be set up will service host and 
refugee communities. 

Based on the WFP-UNHCR JAM Lovua 2018 Final 
Report as well as a study conducted in local villages 
around Lovua settlement, the main needs identified for 
the host communities are: 

. Number of teachers and permanent school 
structures for ensuring a quality education; 
. WASH training on hygiene promotion; 
. Solar lamps in two villages; 
. Mobile health clinic/ambulance for municipality; 
. Livelihoods. 


 

In terms of vulnerabilities, the following were identified: 

. Lack of formal education including Portuguese, 
particularly for women, which makes them 
dependent on their partners (who normally speak 
some level of Portuguese); 
. Lack of potable water; 
. No teachers/schools – children are currently not 
studying; 
. No transportation – village residents are confined to 
their villages and surroundings, which makes it 
difficult to interact with other villages/business and 
engage in livelihoods’ activities. 


 

 

 

 

Response Strategy and Priorities

 

Overall Strategy 

The response plan will be guided by the following 
strategic objectives: 

 

. Sensitization and capacity-building of border guards, 
national police and Migration and Foreigners Service 
(SME) in bordering provinces; 
. Strengthening of protection networks in the border 
areas as a mechanism to ensure referral and initial 
humanitarian assistance; 
. Establishment of SOPs to guarantee access to 
procedures and initial assistance to new arrivals; 
. Provision of legal advice and couselling services, 
appeal, claim and representation of refugees in 
relevants institutions and courts; 
. Strengthening of institutions in the border provinces 
to safeguard prevention, response and assistance to 
victims of SGBV, as well as child protection; 
. Enhancing accesss and quality to education 
services; 
. Advocacy and sensitization of NGOs, churches, 
universities and local communities to ensure 
prevention of xenophobia and appropriate reception 
standards for new arrivals; 
. Registration and verification of refugees to provide 
proper documentation, ensuring access to rights and 
services; 
. Building capacity and provide technical assistance to 
the CNR to process the backlog of 30,000 pending 
asylum claims; 
. Building capacity of partner lawyers to provide 
quality recommendations for new asylum claims; 
. Implementing a pilot CBI (cash-based intervention) 
for livelihoods project to support single heads of 
households; SGBV victims; HIV positive and other 
vulnerable population; 
. Ensure refugees are able to meet their basic food 
and nutrition requirements; 
. Provision of psycho-social support services; 
. Ensuring refugee participation and effective 
communication through the establishment of a 
legitimate and diverse refugee representation 
structures and information sharing system; 
. Improve access to sexual reproductive health 
services, enabling the provision of dignity kits and 
safe clean delivery kits in order to help the most 
vulnerable people to maintain their health, seek 
opportunities and reach their full potential; 
. Offer direct support to 12,500 adolescent girls and 
women of reproductive age, 1,837 pregnant women 
including those at risk of complications of pregnancy 
that could end up in life threatening, disabling 
conditions and diseases like HIV/AIDS. The sexual, 
reproductive health care services will be integrated 
into primary health care interventions, both 
preventive and curative; 
. Improve access to safe water, sanitation and 
hygiene practices within the settlement and nearby 



host communities and ensure readness and 
prepositioning for new influx. Integrate sanitation and 
hygiene on nutrition and education packages; 
. Improve access to safe water, sanitation and 
hygiene practices within the settlement and nearby 
host communities and ensure readiness and 
prepositioning for new influx. Integrate sanitation and 
hygiene in nutrition and education packages; 
. Continue to conduct lifesaving Mine Risk Education 
sessions in Lunda Norte, in the areas where 
refugees are arriving, or have already settled in the 
camps and host communities; 
. Provision of technical advice to partners vis-à-vis any 
necessary demining activity or removal/destruction 
of dangerous items reported. 


Strengthening Livelihoods and Resilience 

RRRP partners support the Angolan Government to 
create an enabling environment for refugees, and to 
strengthen refugees’ self-reliance and host 
communities’ resilience and peaceful co-existence 
through increased livelihood opportunities. The 
provision of support to refugees and local residents 
allows specific needs of vulnerable groups to be 
captured as well as appropriate responses to be 
envisioned in order to meet their unique needs. 

To strengthen livelihoods and resilience for 2019 and 
2020, response partners will focus on enhancing human 
and natural capital assets in the Lovua settlement. The 
livelihoods strengthening will be closely linked to food 
security outcomes in the areas of enhancing food 
availability (through increased production) and access 
to land for agriculture production (with an emphasis on 
income and markets). There is already land available to 
the population in the settlement (25m by 25m household 
plots, and 50m by 100m farming plots) that can be 
utilised for household and kitchen gardens. In addition, 
there are refugees within the settlement who are skilled 
in working the land using appropriate technologies. 

Production will focus on staple crops (maize and 
cassava) but will also include crops that ensure dietary 
diversity (protein and vitamins) and income generation 
(horticultural crops) for the refugee community. The 
income generation aspect will only be possible if there 
is access to markets within and beyond the settlement. 
The Livelihoods Group is currently working to open up 
two markets within the settlement, and also to create 
linkages to markets outside the space. 

RRRP partners intend to provide Rapid Humanitarian 
Assistance establishing agricultural livelihoods 
benefitting 3,346 people (650 households) in Lovua 
settlement. The intervention will be coordinated with the 
other interventions taking place in the area using 
established coordination mechanisms. In fact this 
intervention will cover crucial gaps on strengthening 
refugees’ self-sustainability in food security by 
strengthening agriculture livelihoods, focusing on tubers 
such as manioc and cassava and on urban horticulture 
within the refugee settlement, providing improvement in 
diets (vitamins), income generation and improvement in 
the environment. 

On the other hand the project will support the 
transformation and conservation of manioc and maize 
flour and, finally, the initiative will strengthen capacities 
of local governmental extension services so as to 
provide continued assistance to the refugees. In 
essence, these activities will allow to break the cycle of 
dependence on food supply from partners building on 
their own capacities and self-empowerment. 

Also aiming to enhance refugee inclusion in national 
and local development plans/policies, the joint 
interventios by response partners intend to further 
strengthen needed support to humanitarian, 
development and peace nexus in the refugee response 
context through delivering three collective outcomes: 1) 
Refugees are included in local development planning 
and service provision; 2) Refugees and residents in 
Lóvua are equipped with skills and resources for 
livelihood development and income-generation; and 3) 
Refugees and residents in Lóvua can live peacefully 
and better integrate into the new society. 

Based on the existing needs assessments that aimed to 
map out the refugee and host community needs, RRRP 
partners will focus their livelihoods project on the 
capacity of various focal development groups that will 
be established to ensure sustainability. The technical 
support will focus on capacity building through 
awareness training, promotion and support of individual 
and group initiatives including activities related to social 
integration such as promoting and supporting recreative 
activities. Much attention will be placed on the most 
vulnerable group which will be done with involvement 
and participation of the refugees and host community 
members. All these interventions will be done according 
to humanitarian standards and development 
approaches. 

As voluntary and safe return from Angola to DRC is 
unlikely in the medium-term, response partners will 
continue to work together, including with the 
Government of Angola, to enable refugees to enhance 
their livelihoods, strengthen their resilience and achieve 
self-reliance. In support of this objective, partners will 
continue to engage with the Food Security and 
Livelihood Working Group, and consider incremental 
introduction of targeted resilience-building activities, 
including food assistance for assets (FFA) and cash for 
assets (CFA). Their objective is to either build, maintain 
or rehabilitate productive assets that would foster 
livelihoods and promote achievement of refugees’ self-
reliance.

 

 


Planned Response for 2019 and 2020 

 

It is intented to achieve the following planned response activities and interventions by 2020: 

Protection 

 

. Ensure access to territory and registration of asylum-seekers and refugees; 
. Level of individual documentation of PoCs to increase from 20% to 95%; 
. Establish protection monitoring systems and provide legal advice services where required; 
. Clinical management of rape survivors, psychosocial support specifically for women, girls, 
men and boys, and provision of dignity kits to women of childbearing age; 
. Maintain Women Friendly Spaces and Adolescent Friendly Spaces to provide protective 
environment, including quality information on STI and HIV prevention; 
. Establish case management by inclusion of “best interest determination process” for children, 
including for unaccompanied and separated children, and for survivors of violence and torture. 
Build on already existing procedures and frameworks and the articulation with municipal and 
provincial case management systems for child victims, ensuring provision of targeted and 
adequate assistance and referrals to specialized services, at all stages of service delivery and 
care and cross-border collaboration, if possible; 
. WASH, Health, Protection, Education and other sectors will be trained on IASC guidelines for 
integrating SSGBV prevention and response interventions to their respective sectors; 
. Continue to work in strengthening the capacity of local child protection networks in host 
communities and their articulation with formal case management systems at the municipal and 
provincial levels; 
. Advocate for, and support extension of birth registration services to refugee children throughout 
Angola. By 2020, the goal is to have 60% of newborns under 12 months with birth certificates 
issued by the authorities; 
. Percentage of children with safe access to community spaces for socializing, play, learning, 
etc., which is currently 40%, will reach 60%; 
. Promote dialogue with communities and raise awareness for the prevention of violence against 
children, in particular child trafficking, sexual and economic exploitation and abuse; 
. Percentage of female participants in leadership/ management structures to increase from 30% 
to 50%; 
. Strengthen Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) response with emphasis on Minimum Initial 
Service Package (MISP) implementation to include capacity building, provision of life-saving 
medical supplies and equipment, and specifically support to emergency obstetrical care and 
clinical care for rape survivors; 
. Prevention of HIV transmission will also be prioritized; 
. Raise awareness regarding settlement surroundings and teaching refugees coping skills on

Background and Achievements 

 

Overview 

Burundi is the host of some 73,606 refugees and 
asylum seekers from the DRC, as at September 2018. 
The number of DRC refugees in Burundi is on a steady 
increase which currently amounts to about 600 new 
arrivals per month. Burundi respects the 1951 Refugee 
Convention and maintains an open-doors policy, 
offering refugees, including new arrivals from the DRC, 
access to its territory and protection. Persons fleeing 
the DRC are generally granted prima facie recognition 
as refugees in the accelerated RSD procedures 
conducted by the Eligibility Commission, the CCER 
(Commission Consultative pour Étrangers et Réfugiés) 
while the National Office for the Protection of Refugees 
and Stateless Persons (Office National de Protection 
des Réfugiés et Apatrides / ONPRA) operates as the 
Secretariat of the Commission. Burundi has ratified the 
main international refugee instruments, and since 2008 
has a new law on asylum, which includes most of the 
relevant provisions. 

However, the country is facing the concequences of a 
long-standing political, socio-economic and 
humanitarian crisis which escalated in 2015 and since 
exacerbates the vulnerability of both the local and 
refugee population. Peacebuilding attempts made by 
the international community since 2015, including by 
the African Union (AU) and the United Nations (UN), 
aimed at reconciling the Government and opposition 
parties, have not been able to produce positive results. 

Burundi has organized a referendum on the change of 
the Constitution in June 2018, and launched the new 
Constitution few days after the referendum. This was 
followed by the signing of a roadmap for the 2020 
general elections by various political parties in Burundi 
and the appointment of new members of the National 
Independent Electoral Commission – Commission 
Electorale Nationale Independente (CENI). Both have 
been contested by some of the opposition. Meanwhile, 
the EAC facilitation continued its efforts to convene a 
fifth session of the inter-Burundian dialogue early 
November in Arusha. 

While in 2016, the crisis shifted towards a gradually 
subtle appearance on its political axis with the 
opposition weakened, the democratic space severely 
limited and public freedoms relentlessly curtailed, the 
same politico-security situation triggered by the ruling 
party’s grip onto power caused widespread fear 
amongst many Burundians and kept unfolding against 
a backdrop of growing poverty and food insecurity. This 
has set hundreds of thousands of people on the move; 
leading opposition figures, journalists and civil society 
activists fled into exile. At present, a similar 
development as in 2015 is unlikely, however, 
throughout the present events, its socio-economic 
impact might worsen. 

Today, Burundi remains one of the poorest countries on 
earth. Economic mismanagement along with sanctions 
as well as the impact of climate change have degraded 
the humanitarian situation. Population movements 
inside Burundi due to political repression, tense socio-
economic conditions and/or new threats to livelihoods 
(such as animal diseases, a major spread of the fall 
armyworm and climatic hazards) will likely have a 
significant impact on the refugee population, especially 
so as the internal political situation is being aggravated. 

However, despite the economically challenging 
situation Burundi integrates refugees into its public 
services system, including into the education system. 
However, the situation resulting from the present crisis 
often makes access to basic social services, such as 
health and education, challenging. 

Assistance to DRC refugees is provided in the camps, 
however, in terms of durable solutions, DRC refugees 
can not truly integrate in Burundi, as there are still many 
obstacles to their effective freedom of movement, their 
effective access to paid employment, and to public 
education and health systems. 

The country is involved in a peace process of dialogue 
and reconciliation. The Government decided to 
suspend the international NGOs working in Burundi 
until they comply with the requirements contained in the 
Law on foreign NGOs of January 2017. Many INGOs 
have choosen to comply with these requirements, and 
have, to date, resumed their activities.

Needs and Vulnerabilities

While the focus of the response plan is on refugees and 
people seeking asylum, stateless people are also of 
concern to humanitarian and development partners, as 
well as returnees who have become a major operational 
aspect since September 2017. 

Since 2016, the population of Congolese refugees and 
asylum seekers increases in Burundi. The refugee 
population, at the end of 2016, amounted to 57,469 
individuals, and increased to 66,538 at the end of 2017. 
As of 22 October 2018, almost 74,000 refugees and 
asylum seekers are hosted in Burundi. Most of them 
have fled armed conflict in the Kivu provinces. Should 
the situation deteriorate further, this number might 
increase by 50,000 by the end of 2018, as per the data 
contained in Burundi’s Contingency Planning. The influx 
of refugees from the DRC is also likely to continue given 
that Kinshasa postpones elections repeatedly, with 
resulting tensions. The current estimation for the end of 
2018 is that the number of refugees will stand at at least 
75.315 (with around 30,000 opting to be urban 
refugees) and the number of asylum seekers at 4,685, 
while in 2019 there will be at least 90.000 refugees and 
asylum seekers, mostly from the Kivu provinces as 
fighting there continuous sporadically. 

In light of these developments, RRRP partners will 
focus on ensuring access to the territory, identifying 
accommodation for all influxes, and providing protection 
and multi-sectoral assistance to the refugees in need. 
Burundi has been facing for decades a land issue, which 
is making it difficult to have lands where to build new 
camps for refugees. Advocacy for getting new lands to 
erect refugee camps will remain a top priority. At the 
same time, Burundi will be, in 2019, in a pre-electoral 
year, which may change public attitudes towards 
refugees, and exacerbate violations of their rights. This 
will also have an impact on their capacity to locally 
integrate in the country of asylum, as the readinees of 
the local communities to host them may not be forth-
coming. Livelihoods will be an important resilience 
component in a context of lack of local integration in 
Burundi. 

Host communities 

The protracted socio-political crisis that culminated in 
2015/2016 has contracted the country’s economic 
growth and is taking a growing social toll. The economy 
remains heavily reliant on agriculture, which accounts 
for more than a third of GDP. As a consequence, 
Burundi is highly vulnerable to external shocks such as 
adverse weather and conflicts. Even though the 2018 
agricultural season has been more productive 
compared to the previous seasons, a considerable 
number of people still face acute food insecurity even 
during the harvest and post-harvest periods. Low 
access to land due to the high density of the population 
and depreciation of the national currency is 
compounding the country’s economic precarity. In 
refugee-hosting areas, especially where also returnees 
and IDPs are received, refugees and local populations 
are facing challenges and are in need of assistance 
and support for access to quality services and 
strenghtening their livelihoods. 

 

 

Response Strategy and Priorities 

 

Overall Strategy 

Despite the situation of crisis which prevails in Burundi 
since 2015, the asylum space in the country remains 
open and conducive to the reception of (and the 
provision of protection to) persons seeking asylum, in 
particular for refugees arriving from the DRC. A 
comprehensive Protection Strategy has been defined in 
full collaboration with the governmental technical 
structure in charge of the management of refugees, the 
National Office for the Protection of Refugees and 
Stateless Persons (Office National de Protection des 
Réfugiés et des Apatrides / ONPRA). This Strategy is 
flexible and focuses on reception, registration, RSD, 
and the documentation of refugees and persons 
seeking asylum, their transfer to camps in case of 
refugees in need, the sensitisation of refugees about 
self-reliance, as well as on the coordination of different 
humanitarian actors involved in the provision of services 
to refugees and persons seeking asylum. 

However, it should be noted that the political and 
security situation of the country does not spare to have 
an impact on the well-being of refugees and people 
seeking asylum in Burundi. In 2019, the security 
situation will likely remain uncertain in view of the 
presidential election scheduled for 2020. This situation 
of uncertainty has a negative impact, both on the asylum 
procedure which may be subject to political 
developments as it is currently already the case for 
asylum seekers of Turkish origin/citizenship or for those 
being Rwandan with a military profil or background, and 
for LGBTI cases. 

Under this context, the 2019-2020 response will focus 
on ensuring access to the territory, identifying 
accommodation for all influxes, and providing protection 
and multi-sectoral assistance to the refugees in need. 
Updating the registration system in Burundi will be a key 
priority, as the last verification exercise took place in 


2013. The roll out of Biometric Identity Management 
System (BIMS) will be generalised, and the update of 
the system from proGres V3 to proGres V4 done. 

A particular attention will be given to the protection of 
groups with specific needs based on the age, gender 
and diversity (AGD) policy. SGBV and child protection 
will remain of a great importance, and RRRP partners 
will generalise the use of the Gender-Based Violence 
Information Management System (GBV/IMS) for GBV 
cases. Child protection coordination with all actors 
involved will be a permanent focus, and will consider as 
well the crossborder reunifications. 

Response partners will continue to promote, when 
conditions are conducive, the identification of 
appropriate durable solutions for the refugees in the 
country, while continuing to see with the Government 
how to revive their integration. 

While RRRP partners will seek opportunities for 
alternatives to camps, however, under the current 
political and socio-economic environment this will not be 
promoted as a comprehensive solution. Instead, efforts 
will be made to strengthen the refugee status 
determination (RSD) procedures, provide legal aid, and 
increase the monitoring of detentions. 

The maintaining of the civilian and humanitarian 
character of the refugee settlements and camps will not 
be negotiable, considering the profil of new arrivals who 
are coming from areas in DRC with several armed 
groups. 

Response partners will advocate for the inclusion of the 
Congolese refugees and asylum seekers in the existing 
national strategy, as well as in the National 
Development Plan and UNDAF, so that humanitarian 
and development assistance will be provided to those in 
need developing also strong linkages with the efforts 
undertaken in the area of institutional capacity building. 

RRRP partners will continue toadvocate with key 
authorities for the provision of spaces where to erect 
new camps. At the same time, they will act in a way to 
make these camps respect minimum standards in terms 
of WASH, while putting in place with authorities 
appropriate coordination mechanisms/structures. 

Strengthening Livelihoods and Resilience 

The Action Plan for the Empowerment of Refugees, 
defined and launched in 2018, will continue to be 
implemented in 2019 in order to promote the integration 
and self-reliance of refugees in urban areas. RRRP 
partners will seek to empower their strategic 
partnerships trying also to indentify other development 
actors, in particular to provide for the opportunity to 
reinforce the capacity of refugees, as well as members 
of local populations in the refugee-hosting areas, at the 
economic, participatory and educational level, aiming at 
their overall empowerment. 

Alternative and innovative solutions are found to assist 
refugees to improve their livelihoods and reduce 
dependence and idleness in the camps. Assessments 
will be carried out to identify which sectors have 
potential and provide real economic opportunities. In 
addition, the unrealized economic potential and 
underutilized natural resources (lowlands, marsh, waste 
etc.) can be used to help refugees and host 
communities achieve their self-reliance through 
improvements in enterprises and market access 
(International and regional markets), food security, 
energy production, and environmental conservation. 
Strengthening resilience requires a multisector 
approach, where risk-informed social protection 
interventions, including cash transfers, can become a 
critical component. The strategic capacity building, 
training, investments and broader strategic partnerships 
with UN agencies, NGOs, the private sector, the 
government are needed to support Livelihoods 
programmes focused on refugees needs. 

This approach should take into account the risks 
resulting from the pre-electoral context, as tensions may 
impact i.a. on business possibilities and create a slow-
down of economic activities. Response partners might 
have also to reassess assistance to urban refugees, 
adopting it to their changing needs. The overall strategy 
is aimed at enhancing livelihoods, reducing 
vulnerability, increasing self-reliance and building the 
conditions for peaceful co-existance between the 
refugee and host populations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


Planned Response for 2019 and 2020 

 

RRRP activities will target refugees, as well as their hosting communities, including in areas of IDPs and returnees, with 
the aim of ensuring equal opportunities for all and increasing peaceful cohabitation between the populations.

Background and Achievements 

 

Overview 

The Republic of Congo (RoC) is host to some 15,537 
refugees and asylum seekers from the DRC, with 
13,190 living in the Likouala Department. UN agencies 
and the Government work together to provide these 
refugees with protection and assistance for basic needs 
and a focus on livelihood activities to gradually 
empower this population. 

The RoC is a signatory to international conventions on 
the protection of refugees, including the 1951 Refugee 
Convention relating to the status of refugees and its 
1967 Protocol. Refugee Status Determination (RSD) 
process is managed by the National Committee for 
Assistance to Refugees (CNAR). 

Through needs assessments during 2018, response 
partners have identified and assisted 1,600 persons 
with specific needs, four survivors of sexual and gender 
based-violence were assisted, and 61 separated and 
unaccompanied children were identified and provided 
with adequate response and follow up. Partners ensure 
that refugees and asylum seekers from DRC have 
access to education, healthcare, nutrition, shelter, NFIs 
and water and sanitation in the line with the strategy of 
inclusion of humanitarian response into the national 
system services. As part of the livelihoods programme, 
51 young and adult refugees are currently enrolled in 
vocational training in Betou and 100 persons benefited 
from the support of implementing income generating 
activities. The situation remains volatile in the DRC, 
therefore, voluntary repatriation activities for DRC 
refugees have not taken place. 

In 2019 and 2020, the inter-agency strategy to assist 
refugees and asylum-seekers from DRC in the Republic 
of Congo is built around three major components: (1) 
Protection and essential services; (2) Refugee 
empowerment to reduce their dependency on 
humanitarian assistance; and (3) Refugee access to 
durable solutions. These components of the strategy 
are reflected in participatory assessments conducted 
with refugees and in the overall protection assessment 
conducted in the Republic of Congo. 

Partners will pursue their efforts to identify and protect 
people with specific needs. The agencies will ensure the 
protection of survivors of sexual and gender-based 
violence and children at risk, as well as separated and 
unaccompanied children while relying on national and 
community structures. Partners will maintain refugees’ 
access to education, water, healthcare, sanitation, 
hygiene and shelter. 

Partners will strengthen their efforts to include refugees 
and asylum seekers into national health and education 
systems, while exploring opportunities in the livelihood 
sector to promote empowerment of refugees through 
vocational training, income-generating activities, 
literacy and agricultural and market gardening activities. 

This approach will strengthen the local integration of 
refugees and preserve peaceful coexistence between 
refugees and the local population. UN agencies and 
partners will monitor security developments in DRC and 
will facilitate the voluntary return of some families who 
express their intentions to return.

Needs and Vulnerabilities 

The DRC refugee population in the Republic of Congo 
has remained stable between 2017 and 2018. However, 
with the presidential elections scheduled in December 
2018, there is a risk of repression of demonstrations by 
armed forces that would lead to relatively small influx. 
The agencies estimate that around 7,000 asylum 
seekers would cross the border as a result of post 
electoral disputes. It is also anticipated that 1,000 
refugees will return home as part of a facilitated 
repatriation process. It is expected that the situation will 


become stable in 2020, thus allowing repatriation of 
1,000 refugees, and a slow-down in arrivals. Therefore, 
the estimated refugee population would be between 
21,500 and 22,000 individuals in 2019 and between 
20,500 and 21,000 individuals in 2020. 

However, if the post electoral situation gets worse and 
influx is beyond the planned figures in this Response 
Plan, the Contingency Plan will be activated. Indeed, 
the Government of Congo and the UN agencies have 
prepared a joint Contingency Plan to respond to an 
eventual influx of 100,000 asylum-seekers from the 
DRC. 

Priorities in 2019 and 2020 will be to keep on providing 
tailored assistance to people with special needs 
(including women at risk, elderly people, single parents, 
separated and unaccompanied children, people with 
disabilities, survivors of sexual and gender-based 
violence as well as people with severely degraded 
medical conditions). In addition, the care of people living 
with mental disabilities remains a challenge due to lack 
of structures and specialized staff. 

Children represent 54% of the total population of 
refugees. Traditionally, children are victims of many 
harmful practices such as labour, exploitation, sexual 
and gender-based violence including child marriage. In 
this context, the number of children at risk is very high 
and requires continuous action. 

Most common forms of reported sexual and gender-
based violence are early marriage, rape, physical 
abuse, sexual assault, psychological abuse, denial of 
resources and family abandonment. Case identification 
and reporting remains a challenge due to cultural 
barriers and the lack of judicial sanctions for 
perpetrators of violence who benefit from out-of-court 
settlements or victims' refusal to prosecute in most 
cases. The legal response to acts of sexual and gender-
based violence remains a huge challenge in the area. 
Partners have initiated discussions with local judicial 
authorities and the police to set up a complaints 
mechanism, but most victims are not in favour of lodging 
complaints against the perpetrators. 

Host communities 

The majority of refugees in the Republic of Congo live 
in the Department of Likouala. The current population of 
the Department is estimated at 202,204 inhabitants over 
an area of 66,044 square kilometres. In recent years, 
due in particular to the presence of refugees mainly from 
the Central African Republic (CAR) and the DRC, the 
number of inhabitants in the Department of Likouala is 
increasing. Years back, this situation did not cause any 
problems because historically, the Likouala Department 
is host of many foreigners. However, today, due to the 
blatant development deficit, the Likouala Department 
suffers from significant shortcomings that severely 
hamper its ability to respond in an inclusive way to the 
basic needs of its resident population. This population 
growth is putting pressure on available resources. In 
addition, for almost ten years, humanitarian aid to the 
Likouala Department has been mainly for refugee 
populations. This combination of factors creates 
frustrations and a climate of tension that increasingly 
deepens the social divide between refugee populations 
and other residents of the Department.

 

Response Strategy and Priorities

Overall Strategy 

 

The response plan will be guided by the following 
strategic objectives: 

 

Strategic Objective 1: Protection and essential 
services 

 

. In 2019 and 2020, the agencies will support the 
Government of Congo in issuing identity cards to 
refugees and granting temporary residence permits 
to asylum seekers who are regularly registered for 
their protection. 
. Partners will strengthen their collaboration with 
registry offices at the level of town halls and districts 
to facilitate registration and issuance of birth 
certificates to refugee children born in Congolese 
territory. UN agencies will work with other partners 
and national child protection structures to 
strengthen the coordination framework and explore 
opportunities for pooling child protection efforts. 
. Partners will continue to take action to maintain 
reliable data on the refugee population and their 
potential vulnerability through registration of 
arrivals, deaths, spontaneous returns, births and 
deaths. Identity cards and Provisional Residence 
Permits will be issued to regularly registered asylum 
seekers. 
. Partners will work to consolidate data management 
system on sexual and gender-based violence and 
update standard operating procedures for multi-
sector prevention and response to SGBV. 
Discussions will be conducted with the judiciary to 
explore the possibility of mobile court hearings as 
part of a legal response to incidents of sexual and 
sexual violence. The complaints mechanism will be 
strengthened with police services for survivors who 
wish to file complaints for reparation and justice. 
. Partners will work with NGOs and the community to 
identify, monitor and search for sustainable 



solutions for persons with specific needs. They will 
develop standard operating procedures for 
assistance to people with special needs and 
support the process of setting up a targeted 
assistance allocation committee in partnership with 
other stakeholders. 
. Partners will continue covering tuition fees for 
primary and secondary school refugee students 
and teacher incentives in public primary schools. 
. To respond the multiple health needs of refugees, 
partners will work to increase heath care access 
coverage rate, reduce morbidity rate and the 
occurrence of epidemic diseases by activating 
epidemics surveillance system, providing adequate 
and quality equipment to the health and post 
centres, strengthen health workers capacities, 
employ qualified health professional in quality and 
quantity, provide quality medicines and facilitate 
medicines access for all health centres at any time. 


 

Strategic Objective 2: Refugee empowerment to 
reduce their dependency on humanitarian 
assistance 

 

. In 2019 and 2020, partners will continue providing 
support to the local population through health, water 
and education projects to promote peaceful 
coexistence between refugees and the local 
population. Joint conflict resolution committees will 
be established with support of NGO partners and 
local authorities to manage civil conflicts and 
contribute to awareness raising on the culture of 
peace. Training on conflict management for the joint 
committee and peace committees in host villages 
will be conducted. 
. Partners will continue to support the vocational 
training program for youth and adults and 
strengthen networking in the search for internship 
and employment opportunities for the laureates. 
. The agencies will support the implementation of a 
literacy program at the request of refugees. This 
program will be linked to support programs for 
income-generating activities and vocational 
training. Partners will strengthen their advocacy 
with local authorities for the granting of additional 
farmland to refugees with agricultural projects. 


 

Strategic Objective 3: Refugee access to durable 
solutions 

 

. In 2019 and 2020, partners plan to increase 
awareness and support for local integration for DRC 
refugees who wish to do so. Emphasis will be 
placed on the support program for income-
generating projects to support refugees in the 
empowerment process. 


Strengthening Livelihoods and Resilience 

The significant presence of refugees and asylum 
seekers in the Likouala Department, although not 
creating a major conflict with the local population given 
the socio-cultural environment and access to basic 
social services, remains a challenge. Host populations 
have benefited from the assistance of UN agencies and 
other humanitarian actors in the context of projects to 
improve their living conditions, particularly access to 
health, drinking water and livelihoods (tillage 
equipment, seeds) from 2014 to 2018. 

According to evaluations of development organizations, 
the Likouala Department is one of the poorest and most 
isolated region in the Republic of Congo. In this context, 
response partners continued to facilitate local 
communities’ access to social services in a process of 
integration of refugees and promotion of peaceful 
coexistence between refugees and host population. 

The existence of a community mechanism between 
refugees and local population makes it possible to 
maintain a continuous dialogue between the two 
populations and to prevent conflicts. This mechanism 
deserves to be strengthened to resolve certain civil 
conflicts between communities and to promote a culture 
of peace in refugee reception areas. 

RRRP partners will maintain support to the local 
population through health, water and education projects 
to promote peaceful coexistence between refugees and 
the local population, and build resilience of host 
communities.

Background and Achievements 

 

Overview 

 

Rwanda has been hosting refugees from the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) for almost 22 
years. The Congolese refugee population in Rwanda 
lives in a protracted situation, including those who fled 
DRC in the mid-1990s, as well as more recent arrivals 
to Rwanda, such as during the hostilities that had 
occurred during 2012 and 2013. 


Among the 80,059 Congolese refugees currently in the 
country, the bulk of the population (79,948 individuals), 
which represents 99.8%, lives in the five refugee camps 
of Gihembe, Kigeme, Kiziba, Mugombwa and 
Nyabiheke. At the same time some 110 refugees live in 
urban areas, representing the 0.2% of the total 
Congolese refugee population. 


There are also 5,293 asylum-seekers from the DRC 
who are residing in the camps, some of whom might be 
recognized as refugees in the ongoing verification 
exercise. Since January 2018, a joint verification 
exercise by the Government of Rwanda (GoR) and 
UNHCR has been rolled out in Gihembe and Nyabiheke 
camps, as well as in urban areas of Kigali and Huye. 


Since the beginning of 2018 only a family of six 
Congolese asylum seekers arrived from the DRC into 
Rwanda. As the number of the newly arrived asylum 
seekers is insignificant, the response focused on the 
already existing refugee population in the country. 
Moreover, a Contingency Planning has been prepared 
in a separate document, anticipating new arrivals in the 
event of an emergency situation in the DRC. 


Throughtout 2018, efforts made to strengthen the 
protection environment and advocate for services such 
as registration and documentation and prevention of 
refoulement, life-saving assistance including food and 
nutrition, healthcare, shelter and non-food items, water 
and sanitation services, education, and targeted 
support for the most vulnerable and those with specific 
needs. 


Response partners are actively implementing cash-
based interventions (CBI) in lieu of distribution of core 
relief items. Refugees who reside in the camps receive 
CBI in lieu of food and supplementary feeding is 
provided to all children under-five years and other 
vulnerable groups. Due to critical funding shortages, 
humanitarian agencies plan to profile the refugee 
population, with a view to eventually shift from blanket 
assistance to a targeted approach, while those who are 
self-reliant would graduate from dependency on 
humanitarian aid. 


A total of 480 Refugee Housing units have been 
deployed in terms of shelter, however, due to many gaps 
activities will focus on the improvement of the 
sanitation/hygiene conditions in all camps. Primary 
health services are provided by humanitarian actors 
inside the camps through health centers accessible also 
by the local host communities, while refugees are 
referred to local health facilities for secondary and 
tertiary health care. Support to urban refugees is very 
limited due to lack of funding. Response partners 
provide health services to those in need, however, 
prioritized attention is given to children and the elderly, 
who are among the most vulnerable. The GoR support 
the enrolment of urban refugees into the national health 
insurance system however this will require substantial 
support. 


Campaigns which aimed at promoting schooling, 
resulted in a slight increase of refugee children's 
participation and over 18,000 Congolese refugee 
children were integrated in national primary and 
secondary schools alongside host community students. 
To accommodate refugee children and facilitate their 
school attendance, the capacity of local schools was 
expanded through construction of additional 
classrooms, provision of school equipment and 
materials, as well as hiring and training additional 
number of teachers. 


The inter-agency refugee response for the period 2019-
2020 will have as key protection priorities the access to 
core protection services such as registration, legal 
assistance, community-based protection, prevention of 
and response to sexual and gender based violence 
(SGBV), child protection, and support to persons with 
specific needs, including persons with disabilities. The 
strategy also aims to mainstream refugees into national 
access to justice development programs including legal 
aid and training for national lawyers and jurists. 


Finding durable solutions will remain an important 
element of the response plan. Following the visit of the 
UN High Commissioner for Refugees to Rwanda in April 
2018, UNHCR is working with the Governments of 
Rwanda and the DRC with a view to reactivate existing 
tripartite agreements in support of the eventual safe, 
dignified, and voluntary return of those refugees who 
wish to go home. Moreover, refugees from the DRC will 
continue to benefit from multi-year planning and 
prioritization for the strategic use of resettlement under 
the 2012 regional Comprehensive Solutions Strategy 
for Congolese refugees in a protracted situation. 


The planned refugee response is also based on a 
comprehensive approach to solutions including socio-
economic integration so that refugees can contribute to 
the local economy, as well as complementary pathways 
and resettlement due to the unforeseeable possibility of 
safe and dignified voluntary return. In 2019-2020, 
livelihoods interventions and further socio-economic 
inclusion of refugees in national systems will be 
prioritized in line with the Four Commitments of the 
Government of Rwanda at the Leaders’ Summit in 2016. 


The long-term vision in Rwanda envisages that by 2030 
“All refugees, including potential new influx, are living 


safe, dignified and have productive lives across 
Rwanda outside of camps and supported by 
Government-led services and programmes”. Through a 
shift towards alternatives to camps and self-reliance, 
refugees will be able to contribute to the economy and 
development of the host communities and country.

Needs and Vulnerabilities 

The Government of Rwanda has been generously 
hosting refugees for over two decades and coordinates 
the refugee response with response partners while also 
making significant contributions such as providing land 
to establish refugee camps and ensuring camp 
management and security. Given that Rwanda is very 
densely populated, land scarcity remains a challenge to 
promote livelihood activities. While the refugees in 
Rwanda enjoy a generally favourable protection 
environment, the context of refugee camps and lack of 
livelihood opportunities mean that most refugees are 
still highly dependent upon assistance to meet their 
basic needs like shelter, WASH, food, health, education, 
nutrition and cooking energy. While refugee registration 
is the primary source of information on the needs of the 
refugees and their profile, refugee response partners 
conducted a number of joint assessments to better 
understand the needs, vulnerabilities and coping 
capacities of the refugees. 


Registration & documentation: Refugees and 
asylum-seekers are registered jointly by the GoR and 
UNHCR, and the Government issues refugee identity 
cards to all registered refugees over age 16. Since the 
beginning of 2018, the GoR and UNHCR are 
undertaking a verification exercise of all refugees and 
asylum seekers in both urban and camp settings. As of 
October 2018, all refugees and asylum seekers 
registered in the urban settings of Kigali and Huye, as 
well as Gihembe and Nyabiheke camps, were verified. 
It is aimed that by year-end, all Congolese refugees 
throughout the country would have been verified and 
that the exercise will be undertaken and completed in 
Mahama during the first quarter of 2019. Since the 
beginning of October 2018, the Government started 
issuing Machine Readable Convention Travel 
Documents (MRCTDs) to refugees seeking to cross 
borders to boost their business, study, receive medical 
treatment or reunify with their relatives. Refugees who 
are registered in camp locations face risk of arrest and 
detention if they move outside the camp without the 
requisite documents such as refugee IDs or proof of 
registration, and a letter proving that their absence from 
the camp was authorized, thus arising the need for legal 
assistance and detention monitoring, as well as 
advocacy for greater freedom of movement. 


Community-based protection and persons with 
specific needs: To support effective camp 
management and participation of the community in their 
own protection and services, refugees are supported 
with training and equipment to organize leadership 
committees, women’s committees, security committees, 
and other community-based structures. Some 12 per 
cent of the registered refugee population in Rwanda 
have specific needs (such as child-headed households, 
female-headed households, persons living with 
HIV/AIDS, persons with disabilities, older persons and 
persons with mental disorders). 


SGBV: SGBV is identified as one of the biggest 
protection concern for refugee women and children in 
refugee settings in Rwanda. Underreporting due to 
culture of silence, beliefs about intimate partner 
violence (that are seen as normal family matters) and 
fear of being exposed to community contribute to 
impunity and further protection issues. Late reporting 
especially for girls among the SGBV survivors, results 
in unwanted pregnancies, drop out of school, 
punishment, rejection and stigmatization by the families 
and communities, that further put them at risk of being 
exposed to negative coping mechanisms like survival 
sex, begging etc. In addition, programmatic gaps and 
challenges in other sectors like overcrowding of 
shelters, lack of safe energy and livelihood interventions 
etc. contribute to a heightened risk of SGBV. 



Child protection: Refugee children represent around 
50 per cent of the total population of concern and are 
exposed to various types of risks. Unaccompanied and 
separated children represent 5% of the refugee children 
and they are most at-risk of abuse and exploitation. 
Neglect is among the highest identified risks, affecting 
an estimated 20 per cent of all children, as well as out 
of school children, child labour, child marriage and 
domestic violence. Challenges and concern remain 
regarding children at risk, care arrangements for 
unaccompanied children, family reunification, and 
limited friendly spaces for children and youth. 


Education: Refugee children will continue to be 
enrolled in national schools at the primary and 
secondary levels, with the objective of integrating 100 
per cent of the refugee children into the national 
education system. However, most of the schools lack 
necessary infrastructure, teachers and supplies. Many 
teachers recruited and trained by refugee response 
partners are not yet integrated into the national training 
and payroll schemes. Additionally, since 2015 the 
population in urban settings has been increased 
following the influx of Burundian refugees. Hence, the 
education needs also increased to ensure all urban 
refugee children are enrolled in different national 
schools in and out of Kigali. 


Food: All refugees in Rwanda residing in the camps 
profoundly depend on external assistance and almost 
entirely on humanitarian partners to meet their basic 
food and nutrition needs. They have limited livelihood 
opportunities, primarily due to lack of available land for 
cultivation and livestock rearing - activities that many 
refugees pursued in their home country. Lack of land is 
primarily due to the high demographic pressure in 
Rwanda, which is also a cause for the congestion in 
camps. Due to lack of funding, food rations were cut 
numerous times in the past and if the funding level does 
not increase in 2019 and 2020, additional cuts / 
reductions will occur and may result in turmoil as it 
happened in Kiziba camp in February 2018. 


Health: Although the process of providing refugees with 
Health Insurance is still ongoing, they still rely on basic 
health care support provided by the partners. An urban 
health policy is in place to ensure complying with the 
procedure. The targeting service provision has been 
challenging since there are refugees who are not 
included in the target groups but in need of health 
services. With the growing number of urban population, 
the demand on limited resources allocated increases. 
As a result of continuous advocacy, the Government of 
Rwanda has committed to extend national health 
insurance scheme to urban refugees and the refugee 
students living in urban areas. However, the detail 
implementation plan is yet to be established. With the 
ongoing Ebola Virus Disease (EBV) outbreak in the 
North Kivu and Ituri Provinces of DRC, the risk of spill 
over of the disease to Rwanda and other neighboring 
countries is high. This situation coupled with the volatile 
security situation of the area could exacrbate the 
refugee movement to neighboring countries. 
Strengthening the epidemic preparedness and 
response at the different transit/reception centers and 
camps, including medical screening, appropriate health 
staff trainings, prepositioning of equipment and supplies 
and community surveillance is extremely necessary. 


Energy: Refugees in the camp depend almost entirely 
on firewood for their cooking energy needs, and the 
Minister in charge of Emergency Management (formerly 
known as MIDIMAR) in partnership with UNHCR 
provides quantities that cover about half to three-quarter 
of the monthly needs of the household. For those who 
can afford, they cover their needs for the remaining part 
of the month by purchasing charcoal. The others cover 
their needs by fetching illegally firewood in the camp 
surroundings. The cessation of collection and 
distribution of firewood falls under the Government of 
Rwanda Energy Sector Strategic Plan 2018/2019-2023-
2024 which also aims at protecting the environment and 
combat the detrimental effects of deforestation. 
Alternative sources of energy were identified, which 
would in the long-run translate into substantial savings 
in terms of health impact and environmental 
conservation. In this line, there is an urgent need of 
substantial scale up of alternative sources of energy 
such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), pellets and 
briquettes as main source of cooking; and to connect 
the camps to the national electricity grid (or another 
sustainable system such as solar mini-grids, where 
appropriate). 


Shelter: With the government restriction on the use of 
plastic sheeting, the operation is unable to repair more 
than 3,000 family shelters in plastic sheeting and need 
to transform the roofing structure to corrugated iron 
sheets especially in Kiziba, Gihembe and Nyabiheke 
camp as well as in Kigeme camp where more than 
1,000 shelters have very old roofing structure. As most 
of the shelters in Congolese camps are very old and 
camps are congested with no proper access roads or 
fire break points, the operation focuses on establishing 
better site layouts and re-arranging the camp layouts as 
some of the shelters are situated at high risk zone areas 
which need to be relocated to safer zones. With high 
adequate shelter needs in all the camps, the operation 
need advocacy with the Government on the extension 
of the camps for settlements; also need to have proper 
drainage systems within the camps. 


WASH: The clean water supply to persons of concern 
is within standard (20 liters/person/day) in Gihembe, 
Kiziba and Mugombwa except for the case of 
Nyabiheke and Kigeme where routine supply of water is 
below 15 liters/person/day. With this major challenge in 
the two camps much advocacy or investment is needed 
for upgrading and improving the reliability of water 
supply systems through increasing the quantity of water 
production. There is a need to connect Gihembe host 
community to water system as committed by UNHCR 
after the agreement with District/WASAC to connect the 
camp to the national main water supply network and to 
reduce the water tariff. In terms of sanitation, there is a 
high need for 75 latrines construction especially in 
Kigeme and Kiziba Camps where the achievement is 
above 35 persons per drop hole and none of the 


Congolese camps is meeting the emergency standard 
of 50 persons per shower room, 875 shower rooms are 
required. The most of access ways to sanitation facilities 
should be adapted for people with disabilities (PWD). 
The waste management is focussing on maintaining the 
dumping sites but the access roads are not practical for 
latrine dislodging activities due to camp congestion. 


Livelihoods: Refugees in Rwanda have limited access 
to livelihoods opportunities in the context of scarcity of 
land, lack of self-employment, farming and wage 
employment opportunities. In more concrete terms the 
major challenges include : inadequate farming land 
(both access and availability) as the background of the 
Congolese refugees is rural, limited trade exchanges 
between the camp population and the host 
communities , lack of appropriate documentation (eg., 
valid refugee ID), access to financial services and start-
up capital, poor infrastructure (including access to 
power, market structure), weak market linkage, low 
coverage of existing livelihoods interventions both for 
lack of resources and capacity of the implementing 
partners to deliver at scale, lack of skills and above all 
chronic dependency on humanitarian assistance. The 
current livelihoods support can only reach a portion of 
the refugees and their local host communities because 
of resource constraints. Using a prioritized targeting 
approach, during this 2019-20 period, there is need for 
stregethening livelihoiods and economic inclusion 
interventions for another 5,000 eligible households. 


Environment: Due to the camps’ topography and 
congested rainwater catchment roofs, the camps are 
susceptible to heavy rain water run-off that regularly 
erode top soils hence creating gullies which have 
eventually developed into ravines continues to pause 
danger to human life. Soil erosion is a serious 
challenge, mostly in areas without drainage channels, 
as well as high rate of deforestation in and around the 
camps. While most of the shelters are covered by 
roofing structures which would allow for rainwater 
harvesting, no guttering installed hence leading to 
increased quantity of storm water discharged from the 
camp. The above constitutes a threat to the physical 
environment of the area as well as to the safety of both 
refugees population due to the formation of gullies, in 
addition to the threat on downstream ecosystem, 
Akagera River and its Wetlands, which are the natural 
habitats for various species. 


Host communities 

Learning from existing refugee camps, refugees and 
host communities share resources. Refugee children 
have gone as far as 20km away from the camp in pursuit 
of education options at local schools of their choice in 
the upper secondary. Refugees are allowed to go 
wherever in the district for livelihoods sharing 
opportunites as well as challenges with members of the 
host communities. District hospitals are open to 
refugees and access to quality health services has the 
same meaning for both refugee and local populations. 
In line with the CRRF, response partners have been 
advocating for refugee inclusion in District’s plans for 
increasing opprortunities and promoting peaceful co-
existance and social cohesion. 

 

Response Strategy and Priorities 

 

Overall Strategy 

After more than 22 years living as refugees in Rwanda 
- and no foreseeable possibility of safe, dignified return 
- the response strategy for the protracted Congolese is 
focused on inclusion of refugees in national systems 
and scaling up livelihoods so refugees can graduate out 
of dependency, become self-reliant, and contribute to 
the local economy. 


Key strategic areas for the 2019-2020 refugee 
responses are: 


1. Continue to ensure reception, protection and 
assistance for all persons of concern, including new 
arrivals, with targeted assistance for vulnerable 
persons with specific needs and a community-
based approach; 
2. Advocacy and strategic development partnerships 
for inclusion of all refugees in national systems in 
particular health and education, in line with 
Government policy; 
3. Increase refugee livelihood opportunities through 
targeted assistance based on needs, vulnerabilities 
and capacities; 
4. Increase accesss and quality of education in 
refugee hosting areas. 


In order to avoid a protracted encampment situation and 
a culture of dependency on humanitarian aid, a key 
focus will be to promote socio-economic growth and 
access to livelihoods opportunities especially in urban 
areas, and strengthen partnerships with the private 
sector. Assistance will be targeted based on needs, 
vulnerabilities and capacities of refugees, rather than 
the provision of blanket assistance. A key avenue to 
provide refugees with greater choice in meeting their 
self-identified needs will be shifting to cash-based 
interventions for food assistance. Cash transfers will be 
expanded whenever it is suitable and appropriate to 
address the basic needs of refugees, through sectoral 
or multipurpose assistance. This will be done based on 
feasibility studies and response analysis, with the 


objective of making gains in efficiency, effectiveness 
and refugee self-reliance, while assessing the impact on 
local markets and communities and mitigating 
protection risks. 


With an objective to create livelihoods opportunities to 
the refugees and host communities, UNDP’s supported 
YouthConnekt programme will be extended to youth and 
women refugees and host communities within its target 
groups. In partnership with the existing livelihoods 
intervention implemented by UNHCR, the youthconnekt 
activities targeting refugees and host communities will 
include innovativion competition, some bootcamp 
trainings in entrepeneruship skills, access to finance, 
provision of seed funding and mentorship support. It will 
also include awareness raising activities specifically 
targetting the refugees’ issues such as TV show, 
YouthConnekt hangout (online debates, etc.) 


In line with the Government policy of integrating 
refugees into national systems, a key priority will be to 
ensure integration of services for refugees within the 
host community, especially at the district level. 
Interventions will be designed to avoid parallel systems, 
and respond to the needs of both the host community 
and refugees. 


With an objective of advocating for the inclusion of 
refugees in national systems aligned with the concept of 
Leave No One Behind in Sustainable Development 
Goals, a priority will be to support the Government’s 
domestication of the SDGs and messaging and 
awareness raising activities to ensure that people in 
Rwanda and Government institutions are aware of the 
importance of addressing issues relating to refugees in 
the national development agenda. Focus will be given 
on conducting some reasearch analysis, policy 
dialogues, capcity building activities and awareness 
raising activities on SDGs. 


Strengthening Livelihoods and Resilience 

Following the Comprehensive Refugee Response 
Framework (CRRF), the key priority will be 
strengthening livelihoods and self-reliance of the 
refugees and their host communities by scaling up the 
interventions which are more sustainable and cost-
effective. There is also a need for an integrated 
graduation approach to enhance sustainable livelihoods 
for many refugees who have either not yet received 
livelihoods support or benefited from the on-going self-
reliance activities. 

To make this happen, response partners together with 
the Government will implement the Economic Inclusion 
Strategy, which is currently under review, as the key 
instrument to focus more on the implementation of 
market based livelihoods interventions both in the areas 
of farming and business as well as creating more wage 
employment. According to government statistics and 
other partners’ assessment, agriculture remains as the 
main livelihoods option and key economic activity for the 
majority of the rural population in Rwanda including 
people living in the refugee hosting districts. 


However, because of refugees limited access to 
agricultural land and farming (including crop, livelstock, 
fishery and forestry), the potential of this sector was less 
realized in the past. As a country initiating the 
application of the CRRF in follow-up to the New York 
Declaration, the Government’s approach to open up 
opportunities for farming for the refugees as well as their 
local host community outside the camp by linking with 
the market, provides an enabling environment for 
enhancing resilience of the refugees to food insecurity, 
income shocks. 


Moreover, RRRP partners’ assessments suggest 
alternative ways of enhancing access to land within and 
outside the camp. Through the response, the operation 
plans to enhance agriculture related interventions 
further through better market linkage. 


The current move to strengthen joint UN programming 
under ‘Delivering as One’ in Rwanda by partnering with 
other UN development agencies has also potential. On 
the other hand, assessment and scoping studies done 
by the current and future partner agenicies from the 
private sector as part of the project also show strong 
business potential for many of the refugees if they are 
adequately supported through training and access to 
financial services. Wage employment is another 
potential area which require further support in terms of 
both policy and programme interventions.

Background and Achievements

Overview 

Throught 2018, Uganda has received an enormous 
influx of Congolese refugees and asylum-seekers, who 
have entered as a result of continuing insecurity and 
ethnic violence in the DRC. 

There are some 271,9766 Congolese refugees and 
asylum seekers who are being hosted in Uganda, while 
the number of refugees from South Sudan and Burundi 
stands at 985,512 and 36,677, respectively. Another 
70,988 refugees from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Rwanda, 
Somalia and Sudan have lived in protracted exile in 
Uganda for the past three decades. 

6 This baseline population figure is based on data provided by the 
OPM/RIMS, as of June 2018, and UNHCR/OPM verification figures, 
as of June 2018. 

Over one million refugees have fled to Uganda in the 
last two and a half years, making the Pearl of Africa the 
third largest refugee-hosting country in the world after 
Turkey and Pakistan7, with 1.36 million refugees by 
June 2018. More than 60 percent of Uganda’s refugees 
are under the age of 18, one of the most visible 
consequences of conflicts in neighboring countries - 
and with clear implications for the provision of protection 
services. 

7 UNHCR, 2017 Global Trends Report: 
http://www.unhcr.org/5b27be547 

Twelve of Uganda’s 121 districts host the overwhelming 
majority of refugees. About 92 percent live in 
settlements alongside the local communities, mainly in 
northern Uganda or West Nile (Adjumani, Arua, 
Koboko, Moyo, Lamwo and Yumbe) with smaller 
numbers in central Uganda or Mid West (Kiryandongo 
and Hoima) and southern Uganda or South West 
(Kyegegwa, Kamwenge and Isingiro). Urban centres 
are home to eight percent of the refugee population, 
especially Kampala. 

Refugee outflows into Uganda are likely to continue in 
2019 and 2020 due to unrest and widespread human 
rights violations in North Kivu as well as inter-
community and inter-ethnic violence in Ituri. The nexus 
between political and sectarian violence will remain a 
key feature of the DRC’s political instability, whereby a 
deeper political crisis is likely to revive and galvanize 
armed groups and militias across the country. Already, 
several armed groups operate in Eastern DRC, close to 
the border with Uganda, and have a long history of 
atrocious attacks on civilians, including killings, 
abductions and rape. Among them are the Allied 
Democratic Forces/National Army for the Liberation of 
Uganda (ADF/NALU), the March 23 Movement (M23) 
and the Mayi Mayi groups. 

On 1 August, the DRC Minister of Health declared a new 
Ebola virus outbreak in North Kivu, which quickly 
spread to Ituri. Ongoing conflict and armed activities of 
militia groups in these areas make the response to the 
outbreak extremely challenging. Without access to 
health care or treatment in the Ebola-affected areas, 
there is a risk that infected patients or Congolese fearing 

infection may use refugee routes into Uganda to seek 
medical attention. 

Food insecurity in the DRC may marginally contribute to 
refugee outflows into Uganda, especially from Ituri. 
Interethnic violence in Djugu and Imuru territories has 
led to a disruption of the agricultural system, resulting in 
significant loss of harvest. In the likelihood of meagre 
harvest seasons, more Congolese will cross to Uganda 
in search of a food. 

Some 100,000 new refugee arrivals are expected to 
cross to Uganda in 2019 and 40,000 others in 2020, 
bringing the DRC refugee population to approximately 
509,000 in 2019 and 539,000 in 2020. Should political 
tensions defuse and security improve in North Kivu and 
Ituri, return to the country of origin may become a reality, 
though marginal in scope. This plan puts the number of 
expected returns to 10,000 in 2019 and 20,000 for the 
following year. 

CRRF and Uganda’s refugee policy 

The Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework 
(CRRF), formally launched in March 2017, embraces 
existing initiatives, mechanisms and policies seeking to 
address the needs of refugee and host communities in 
Uganda. 

Uganda’s favourable protection environment for 
refugees is grounded in the 2006 Refugee Act and the 
2010 Refugee Regulations. These legislations allow 
refugees freedom of movement, the right to work, 
establish a business, own property and access national 
services, including primary and secondary education 
and health care. 

Congolese asylum seekers, as well as South 
Sudanese, are granted refugee status on a prima facie 
basis, while refugees from other nationalities undergo 
Refugee Status Determination (RSD) interviews with 
the Refugee Eligibility Committee, an inter-ministerial 
body. 

Through its Settlement Transformative Agenda (STA), 
Uganda pursues a non-encampment policy to refugee 
protection and assistance. Refugees are provided with 
a plot of land for housing and cultivation and can settle 
alongside their host communities. 

The CRRF seeks to advance Uganda’s STA, embedded 
into the National Development Plan II (NDP II, 2016-
2021), including through the implementation of the 
humanitarian refugee response (emergencies and 
protracted situations) and development-oriented 
interventions like the Refugee and Host Populations 
Framework (ReHoPE), under the United Nations 
Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF). CRFF’s 


long-term goal is sustainability of STA and inclusion of 
refugees into national and local development plans. 

A multi-stakeholder CRRF Steering Group, co-chaired 
by the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) and the 
Ministry of Local Government (MoLG), supports the 
practical application of CRFF, with technical support 
from the CRRF Secretariat. The CRRF Steering Group 
consists of 32 members from Line Ministries, 
Government Departments and Agencies, Local 
Governments, development and humanitarian donors, 
representatives of UN Agencies, national and 
international NGOs, the private sector and international 
financial institutions. 

In January 2018, the CRRF Steering Group adopted a 
roadmap, with milestones and priority interventions for 
refugee stakeholders between 2018 and 2020 bridging 
the gap between NDP II and NDP III. Creating entry 
points for non-traditional refugee responders in Uganda, 
the roadmap highlights the following priority focus 
areas: adaptation and standardization of refugee 
response and protection based on lessons learned; 
access to quality education for refugee and host 
communities; water delivery and infrastructure; 
environment and energy; health care; and livelihoods, 
resilience and self-reliance. 

For the first time in Uganda’s history, national and local 
development plans will include refugee issues. In March 
2018, the Ministry of Education introduced its Education 
Response Plan (2018-2021) with the aim to respond to 
the additional strains placed on the educational system 
in refugee-hosting districts. Following this lead, the 
Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Water and 
Environment have also begun developing integrated 
response plans, due for release in the second half of 
2018 and early 2019 respectively. 

Achievements and challenges 

Border and protection monitoring along the Ugandan 
borders ensured that some 88,737 new refugee arrivals 
from the DRC were provided with reception assistance 
and transferred to settlements in the first semester of 
2018. No case of refoulment was reported in 2018. 

The Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) continued to 
undertake registration and documentation of refugees. 

Following serious allegations of fraud and corruption 
within the refugee response, UNHCR and WFP reached 
out to the Government in late 2017 to seek cooperation 
in addressing growing concerns about the accuracy and 
reliability of refugee data used for fundraising, 
programming and of assistance. 

In response, the government and UNHCR launched a 
verification of all refugees in Uganda in March 2018, 
using UNHCR biometric systems. About 104,305 
Congolese refugees were verified as of June, with 
verification continuing until the end of the year. 

Furthermore, a memorandum of understanding 
between UNHCR and the Government of Uganda, 
signed in mid 2018, enabled OPM to use UNCHR’s 
enhanced biometric systems to register refugees. 

In the settlements, refugees continued to receive 
monthly food rations, household items and access to 
multi-sectoral services, in addition to a plot of land for 
housing and farming. 

Following the sudden and mass refugee influx from 
DRC’s Ituri province in late December 2017, several 
transit and reception centres were built or expanded in 
2018. This includes construction of Nyakabande’s new 
transit centre (Kisoro district) and Matanda transit 
centre (Kanungu district); refurbishment and repair of 
Bubukwanga transit centre (Bundibugyo district); and 
expansion of Kyaka II and Kyangwali reception centres. 
Furthermore, six new settlement areas were opened in 
Kyangwali (four) and Kyaka II (two) to provide land and 
shelter for new refugee arrivals from the DRC. 

RRP partners opened 72 kilometres of access roads in 
Kyangwali and Kyaka II and rehabilitated another 43 
kilometres of district roads in Hoima and Kyegegwa to 
ease relocation and settlement of new arrivals. In 
northern Uganda, 3.2 kilometres of roads were opened 
in Rhino, while another 25.4 kilometers of existing roads 
were rehabilitated and maintained in Rhino and Imvepi 
(10.4 km) and Adjumani settlements (15 km). 

Partners continued to support the national health care 
system as well as health facilities and referral services 
in and around refugee settlements, helping maintain the 
crude mortality rate and under five mortality rate at 0.1 
death every 1,000 people per month – below the non-
emergency standard of 1 death every 1,000 people per 
month. 

Due to cholera and Ebola outbreaks in the DRC in 2018, 
RRP partners in coordination with the Ministry of Health 
deployed resources to strengthen screening measures 
at entry points and expand traditional and community-
based disease surveillance systems. 

In the first six months of 2018, supply of safe drinking 
water was maintained at 16 liters per person per day 
(l/p/d) across the refugee response. About 98.8 percent 
of water was provided through water trucking in 
settlements in settlements hosting Congolese refugees. 

Building on existing complaint mechanisms, partners 
launched in October 2018 an inter-agency centralised 
refugee feedback, complaint and resolution mechanism 
to enhance accountability to affected populations. 

In line with the Grand Bargain’s commitment to improve 
joint and impartial needs assessments, a joint inter-
agency multi-sector needs assessment of refugee and 
host communities was carried out in 12 refugee-hosting 
districts and 30 refugee settlements to provide 
evidence-based data for the development of the 2019-
2020 RRP. 

The level of funding for the refugee response in Uganda 
reached an all time low this year, with only 42 percent 
of earmarked and unearmarked contributions received 
as of October 2018. While the number of refugees per 
1,000 inhabitants has tripled to 35 since 2016 –putting 
a huge pressure on local resources and services, 
external aid has been progressively dwindling over the 


years, causing major gaps in the refugee response. 
RRP partners continued to face enormous challenges 
in stabilising existing programmes and often meeting 
the minimum standards of service provision, let alone 
investing in long-term and more sustainable 
interventions. 

Severe underfunding has particularly compromised the 
quality of child protection and education services and 
limited investments in prevention and response to 
Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV), 
environmental protection, support for host communities, 
and permanent community infrastructure. With 34 
percent of its population below income poverty line (US 
$1.9 per person per day8), Uganda may be unable to 
fully realize a comprehensive refugee response and 
maintain its progressive refugee policy without 
adequate support from the international community.

The base Congolese refugee population includes 
271,967 individuals, based on OPM-UNHCR 
verification findings from those settlements where 
verification was completed as well as on OPM Refugee 
Information Management System (RIMS) data for 
settlements where verification is ongoing, as of June 
2018. The refugee population is anticipated to further 
grow to 539,000 million individuals by the end of 2020, 
taking into account likely scenarios for influxes, 
population growth, and possible opportunities for 
voluntary return in safety and dignity. 

 

Concerning the Ugandan host community, the Country 
RRP will primarily target populations in 15 refugee-
hosting sub-counties with a total population of 
1,398,413 individuals, anticipated by 2020. 
Communities and individuals in refugee-hosting sub-
counties will benefit from assistance along specific 
targeting criteria, different for each sector, and to the 
extent that resources permit. Entire refugee-hosting 
districts may also benefit from system-level 
interventions. 

 

 

 

Needs and Vulnerabilities 

The needs analysis underpinning Uganda’s response 
plan for all the refugee populations, including for 
Congolese, South Sudanese, Burundians and those 
from other neighbourhing countries, is broken down by 
sector and is based on government sector response 
plans, where available (Education, Health, WASH) and 
the findings of the 2018 joint inter-agency Multi Sector 
Needs Assessment (MSNA) of refugee and host 
communities, which was purposely carried out to inform 
this plan. Other existing needs assessments and 
studies have been used to provide further evidence on 
needs and gaps. 

Education: It is expected that by the end of 2018 the 
one third of Uganda’s refugee population will consist of 

children of primary and secondary school age. At the 
same time, half of the projected new refugee arrivals by 
the end of 2020, will be pupils with a need of pre to 
post-primary education services, putting a further strain 
on the already stretched capacity of national and 
district-level education systems – and compromising 
both access to and quality of education service delivery. 

Currently, 53 percent of the primary-aged and 92 
percent of the secondary-aged children are out of 
school, and an average of 22 percent are enrolled in 
grades lower than expected for their age. Host 
community enrolments are equally striking: a gross 
enrolment rate of 120 percent at primary level shows 
incidences of over and under-age enrolment, while an 


18 percent low enrolment rate at secondary level 
indicates critical gaps. These are compounded by high 
drop-out rates at all levels and alarming indicators at 
primary level such as 154 pupils per classroom ratio and 
85 pupils per teacher9.

Teenage Pregnancy, December 2017; Uganda Demographic and 
Health Survey 2016 (UDHS) conducted by the Uganda Bureau of 
Statistics between June 1 

12 UNHCR/REACH Joint Multi-Sector Needs Assessment. 

Findings from the 2018 joint inter-agency MSNA, 
reinforced by additional references, point to a number of 
critical factors preventing refugee and host community 
children in Uganda from accessing a quality education. 

Out of the total number of refugee households that 
reported having at least one child out of school, 36 
percent in Koboko district hosting DRC refugees cited 
child marriage as a barrier to girls’ education. Host 
community households with at least one child out school 
also reported child marriage as a reason for girls being 
out of school. 

The highest prevalence of child marriage is in northern 
Uganda, where the majority of the refugee-hosting 
districts are located10. A 2016 survey indicates that as 
many as three in ten Ugandan girls have their first child 
before their 18th birthday; and more than a third marry 
before they turn 1811. Early marriage and pregnancy 
lead to girls dropping out of school, unlikely to ever 
return. Non-formal education pathways such as catch 
up classes and accelerated education programmes, are 
entry points of return to formal education for these girls 
but need to be part of a more holistic package of 
interventions to mitigate the protection risks for 
adolescent girls from both refugee and host 
communities. 

Although Uganda’s Universal Primary Education policy 
stipulates free compulsory primary education of good 
quality for all children, ‘hidden costs’ to accessing 
education remain. Financial constraints are among the 
main hindrances to educational enrolment and retention 
in schools, with parents compelled to cover the costs of 
scholastic materials, school uniforms and examination 
fees. According to the 2018 joint inter-agency MSNA, 
out of the households with at least one child out of 
school, 31 percent of refugee households and 45 
percent of host community households consider the 
cost of education a prohibitive one. Of them, 54 percent 
of refugee households and 95 percent of host 
community households cited tuition fees as the highest 
unaffordable expenditures related to education, with 
refugee children more likely to access scholarships or 
tuition subsidies from humanitarian organizations 
compared to Ugandan children12. 

Low enrolment and attendance, and high dropout rates 
among children and youth can also be attributed to 
language barriers.,Refugees from Burundi, DRC and 

other Francophone countries face challenges in 
adjusting to a new curriculum in a foreign language13. 
The 2018 joint inter-agency MSNA found that the 
highest percentage of households with school-age 
children where at least one child is not attending school 
are in districts hosting refugees from Francophone 
countries such as DRC and Burundi, namely Kyegegwa 
(46 percent), Hoima (33 percent), Kamwenge (32 
percent) and Isingiro (22 percent). Other studies confirm 
the low attendance rates of Congolese children in the 
same districts14. In the multi-linguistic setting of refugee-
hosting areas, support to mother-tongue literacy, 
language bridging courses, community involvement in 
schools and engagement of bi-lingual teacher 
assistants in classrooms are highly needed to mitigate 
these critical challenges.

from Uganda 2018. Economic Policy and Research Centre, Cardiff 
University and UNICEF Uganda. 

16 ECHO, Education Monitoring Mission – Uganda report 2017. 

The 2018 joint inter-agency MSNA shows that out of the 
households with at least one child out of school, 94 
percent of refugee and 100 percent of host community 
households consider being ‘too young’ as a reason for 
their children not attending school, with specific 
reference to children of pre-primary age, between 3 to 5 
years. This belief could be one of other factors 
contributing to the low gross enrolment rates of children 
of pre-primary age in both refugee and host 
communities, at 39 percent and 19 percent respectively. 
A study on child poverty and deprivation in refugee-
hosting areas in Uganda also found that being ‘too 
young’ (43.2 percent) as well as parental indifference 
(19.1 percent) as the most cited reasons by surveyed 
households for children of primary school age being out 
of school15. 

Persistently low enrolment and attendance rates for 
both refugee and host community children and youth 
can be found in post-primary education. The gross 
enrolment rate (GER) among refugee children stands at 
11 percent for secondary education. Only 18 percent of 
Ugandan children of secondary school age living in 
refugee-hosting districts are enrolled in secondary 
education, which is lower than the national average of 
27.1 percent. There are still sub-counties without a 
secondary school, including where refugees are hosted, 
and only 18 secondary schools in refugee-hosting 
districts in northern Uganda, including government, 
community and private schools16. 

A key barrier for refugees to access secondary 
education is the lack of or non-acceptance of 
certification proving they have completed primary 
education in their home country. Other constraints 
include the long distance between home and the 
nearest school, and poor school facilities. According to 
the joint inter-agency MSNA, examination fees 


represent a prohibitive cost for secondary school-aged 
children, preventing them to transition from upper 
primary into secondary. There are some scholarship 
programmes available for high achieving students from 
vulnerable households, but the number of places is 
limited. 

Environment & Energy: Refugees and hosts are 
mostly dependent on natural resources to meet their 
basic needs for cooking energy, materials for shelter 
and agricultural land. Some also generate income by 
selling biomass and non-wood forest products. In 
addition to leading to environmental degradation and 
reduced groundwater recharge and supply, these 
demands contribute to increased risk of SGBV for 
women and children whilst collecting fuel wood, to 
reduce food and nutrition security and to deplete 
sources of cooking fuel. The health risks associated 
with exposure to unmanaged solid waste remain a 
critical concern. Competition over diminishing natural 
resources has the potential to exacerbate tensions 
between refugee and host communities. 

Environmental screening has not been integrated in 
settlement planning, magnifying the risks of 
environmental and social hazards such as flooding, 
conflicts over land use and resource access, and loss of 
vegetation, wetlands and local watersheds. While every 
settlement requires an Environmental and Social Impact 
Assessments (ESIA) as the basis for site-specific 
environmental management and site planning, ESIA 
have been officially undertaken only in refugee 
settlements in Rwamwanja and Arua districts, with 
Bidididi settlement currently underway. 

Refugees are often settled in environmentally marginal 
locations with population densities up to ten times the 
national average. The demands on the ecosystem from 
rapid refugee influxes outpace planning and 
implementation of remedial measures. The recent influx 
from the DRC has placed significant pressure on forest 
resources especially around Kyaka II and Kyangwali 
settlements, while vegetation cover is greatly depleted 
in the north, especially around settlements in Adjumani, 
Yumbe and Arua. Land use conversion from forest 
cover to agricultural use is prevalent. The 2018 joint 
inter-agency MSNA found that there is a significant gap 
in knowledge of agroforestry principles where only 33 
percent of refugee and 27 percent of host community 
households had training in good agricultural practices 
(GAP). 

While reforestation and afforestation efforts are 
underway, dedicated woodlots for fuel and agroforestry 
interventions are needed in all settlements at a much 
larger scale, including deliberate planning for 
management of planted trees for at least a year to 
improve survival rates. 

Uganda’s National Environment Act (1995) stipulates 
the establishment of district Environment Protection 
Committees to act as local regulatory, monitoring and 
feedback mechanisms, but only few exist today due to 

lack of resources. None of the refugee settlement 
across the country is integrated in existing Catchment 
Management Plans. 

Access to sustainable energy for sufficient and clean 
cooking, lighting and power remain key challenges in 
the refugee settlements and in Uganda at large. Energy 
for productive uses to support livelihood activities and 
appropriate technology for food preservation are 
scarcely available. Over 75 percent of refugees17 are 
without any renewable source of energy. 

17 UNHCR, 2018 mid year report. 

According to the 2018 joint inter-agency MSNA, on 
average refugee and host community households own 
less than one light source and 1.5 light source per family 
respectively, with heavy reliance on low-quality fuels 
such as kerosene and firewood. As a result, the risk of 
indoor air pollution, respiratory tract infection, and eye 
diseases increase. Solar lanterns are inconsistently 
provided and some are sold for cash to meet other 
needs. Furthermore, a larger-scale solar street lights 
coverage is required to improve security and reduce the 
risks of SGBV. Market-based interventions to increase 
access to quality energy products are needed. 

The 2018 joint inter-agency MNSA shows that 93 
percent of refugee and host community households 
depend on fuel wood energy for cooking, with only 45 
percent of refugee and 20 percent of host community 
households reporting use of energy saving stoves. 
Distributed stoves are often unused and training is not 
provided to improve adoption. While constructed Lorena 
stoves tend to have better adoption, there is a need to 
expand manufacturing training programs for local 
artisans. There is low adoption and availability of 
alternative cooking fuels such as briquettes and biogas. 

Refugee households use on average 22 percent of their 
income for energy, with women and children spending 
12-24 hours a week for firewood collection. Firewood 
consumption in northern Uganda averages between 
2.5-4.5 kg per person per day, with host communities 
being on the higher end of that range18. This means that 
at least 1.3 million tonnes of firewood are needed every 
year to meet the firewood consumption needs of over 
1.36 million refugees, including Congolese refugees as 
well as South Sudanese, Burundians and others, 
equating to a yearly demand of nearly 20 5-year-old fast 
growing trees per individual. 

18 GiZ, 2018; FAO, 2017. 

Energy efficiency and climate change mitigation need to 
be mainstreamed across sectors, especially through 
implementation of solar power and sustainable cooking 
energy. Similarly, all partners involved in the refugee 
response need to integrate environment mitigation 
measures with emergency preparedness, response, 
stabilization and empowerment measures across all the 
sectors. 

Food Assistance: Almost the majority of refugee 
populations in Uganda are receiving food assistance in 
the settlements either in-kind or through cash transfers. 


According to the 2018 joint inter-agency MSNA, the 
highest percentage of refugee households classified as 
people in need within the food assistance sector were 
found in the Southwest (16 percent) hosting mainly 
refugees from DRC and Burundi, followed by West Nile 
(14 percent) and the Midwest (9 percent) hosting the 
majority of refugees from South Sudan. 

At national level, 18 percent of refugee households 
were found to have low food consumption score (poor 
or borderline), with 32 percent and 25 percent in 
Kyegegwa and in Kamwenge respectively (hosting 
DRC refugees). Households in Kyaka II (9 percent) in 
Kyegegwa had one of the highest percentages of poor 
food consumption score across all assessed 
households. 

Sixty seven percent of refugee households reported 
insufficient access to food for all the members of the 
household in the 7 days prior to data collection and 72 
percent reported non-governmental assistance to be 
the primary source of food. 

While 38 percent of refugee households reported 
agriculture as one of their primary sources of 
livelihoods, 70 percent of refugee respondents reported 
to have access to land for cultivation during the most 
recent agricultural season. Among the latter, 73 percent 
reported that the land was not sufficient to provide food 
for the entire household. With anticipated refugee 
influxes through to 2020, it is likely that the reduction of 
available land for long-term cases will continue, 
including agricultural land. 

There is a need to standardize general food assistance 
across the refugee response in Uganda and 
increasingly roll out cash-based transfers for both 
general food assistance and livelihood and food-for-
assets interventions. In order to respond to the different 
level of vulnerability of different refugee populations, 
food rations need to be diversified – and a plan will be 
conceived in 2019 to that effect. 

It remains critical for the Food Assistance sector to 
establish strong linkages with the Livelihood&Resilience 
sector to help promote refugee self-reliance, especially 
through agricultural interventions. Such cross-sector 
coordination is fundamental to design programmes that 
help refugees access markets, sell off surplus produce 
and, as a result diversify their diet and meet other needs 
(e.g. through Purchase for Progress programs). 

Additional food security and nutrition and market 
assessments are needed to help inform food assistance 
programming and link market support to food and cash-
based interventions. 

With over 539,000 refugees from the DRC likely to be in 
need of food assistance by 2020, it is of paramount 
importance to ensure a healthy food pipeline throughout 
the RRP period in order to reduce the risk of malnutrition 
among refugees and their reliance on negative coping 
mechanisms to secure food. 

Health & Nutrition: In view of achieving provision of 
integrated health services and equitable access for both 
refugee and host communities, there is an urgent need 
to strengthen the health care system at national, district 
and local level through investments and measures that 
enhance its capacity to respond to current needs and 
future shocks. 

With an increasing refugee population and anticipated 
refugee influxes through to 2020, the capacity and 
resources of primary healthcare institutions remain at a 
constant risk of being overstretched. In particular, 
refugees living in urban areas and outside the 
settlements access government health facilities that 
have not planned for additional patient caseload, 
leading to increased workload on health workers, 
frequent shortage of medicines and out-of-pocket 
medication expenditures by both refugee and host 
communities during stock-out periods19. 

19 MoH HSIRRP, 2018. 

The 2018 joint inter-agency MSNA revealed that 51 
percent of refugee and 17 percent of host community 
households were categorized as people in need in the 
health sector, with refugee households ranking as high 
as 64 percent and 57 percent in Mid West and South 
West respectively (hosting DRC and Burundian 
refugees). 

At a district level, 71 percent of refugee household 
classified as “in need” in Kamwenge, 69 percent in, and 
56 percent Hoima – all districts hosting DRC refugees. 

Both refugee (55 percent) and host community 
households (44 percent) reported lack of drugs at health 
facilities as the biggest challenge in accessing health 
services for those who sought treatment but were 
unable to receive it, with the highest percentage in West 
Nile (56 percent). Cost of medicines was also reported 
as a barrier to access health services for refugee (20 
percent) and host community households (34 percent), 
with the highest percentage for refugee households in 
South West (36 percent) and West Nile for host 
community households (37 percent). 

Uganda’s current existing health care system consists 
of 100 service delivery points, of which only 63 percent 
are permanent, 64 percent are government-accredited 
and 56 percent require upgrading20. According to 2017 
Health Information System (HIS) data, the number of 
consultation per clinician a day is 68 in settlements 
hosting Burundian refugees, 57 in settlements hosting 
DRC refugees and 50 in those hosting South Sudan 
refugees. There is a need to set up new additional 
health facilities in line with the government guidelines 
and enable them to deliver the full package of health 
interventions as per the universal health access 
package. This requires investments for staffing, medical 
and nutrition supplies, infrastructure, equipment, 
referral services as well as skills training of existing 
medical personnel. 

20 MoH HSIRRP, 2018. 

There is a need to strengthen reproductive health 
services across the refugee response to increase the 
number of deliveries attended by skilled health workers. 


As of June 2018, 92 maternal deaths were reported in 
average every 100,000 live births, with 96 percent of 
deliveries attended by skilled personnel in settlements 
hosting DRC refugees. 

There is need to expand family planning, adolescent 
sexual and reproductive health (ASRH), cervical cancer 
screening and comprehensive HIV/AIDS services. 
Currently, 14,732 refugees and host community 
members living with HIV/AIDS are receiving anti-
retroviral treatment (ART), of which 35 percent are 
refugees and 65 percent local Ugandans. The need for 
HIV/AIDS prevention and response interventions is 
extensive, given poor knowledge and awareness about 
HIV, sociocultural factors of HIV/AIDS-related stigma, 
inadequate provision and low uptake of HIV prevention 
and treatment services. 

Refugee-producing countries neighbouring Uganda and 
refugee-hosting areas inside Uganda are vulnerable to 
communicable disease outbreaks due to cross border 
movement, congestion, inadequate sanitation and 
geographic location of settlements. As part of the 
preparedness and response to cholera, meningitis and 
measles outbreaks and risk of Ebola, there is a need to 
strengthen infection prevention and control, strengthen 
surveillance, stock essential drugs and improve the 
capacity of health care providers to effectively respond 
to potential disease outbreaks, especially at district and 
local level. More efforts are needed to improve health 
facilities serving refugees and to facilitate their 
accreditation by the Ministry of Health. 

According to the 2017 Food Security and Nutrition 
Assessment (FSNA), the prevalence of Acute Global 
Malnutrition (GAM) remained at within the acceptable 
standard in settlements hosting refugees from DRC. 
However, a nutrition screening of Congolese new 
arrivals in 2018 through Mid-Upper Arm Circumference 
(MUAC) measurements showed that both GAM and 
Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) were above 
emergency thresholds, at 11.2 percent and 2.5 percent 
respectively. 

As per WHO classification, anaemia among children 
aged 6-59 months was ‘high’ in most refugee 
settlements across Uganda, with Nakivale, Oruchinga 
and Kampala classified as ‘medium’. Anemia among 
non-pregnant women aged 15-49 years was ‘medium’ 
in all settlements hosting refugees from the DRC. 

Against this backdrop, more efforts are needed to 
enhance targeted supplementary feeding programme, 
skills training for health workers in Infant and Young 
Child Feeding (IYCF) practices in emergencies and 
expand use of a newly introduced vaccine in the routine 
immunization. Preventive approaches to address acute 
malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies are needed 
to complement the existing curative measures. 

Livelihood & Resilience: Despite Uganda’s 
progressive approach to refugee management, 
refugees living in settlements and their host 
communities remain vulnerable and at risk of recurring 
shocks. At least 80 percent of refugees in Uganda live 
below the international poverty line of US$ 1.9 per day21. 
According to the 2018 joint inter-agency MSNA, 26 
percent of refugee households reported relying on 
humanitarian aid as a coping strategy to support family 
members in the 30 days prior to data collection.

in Uganda, pg.14 

The alarming rate of dependency of refugees in 
Nakivale settlement (67 percent) highlights the risk for 
refugees to become dependent on humanitarian 
assistance if interventions do not adequately focus on 
sustainable and resilient livelihoods going forward. 
FAO’s Resilience Index Measurement Analysis (RIMA) 
found that refugee households are less resilient than 
host community households due to low education 
levels, poor diversification of income sources, limited 
number of crops cultivated and productive assets.22 
Moreover, the recent vulnerability study found that the 
time refugees have spent in Uganda is not closely 
correlated with levels of vulnerability23. 

The joint inter-agency MSNA24 found that 51 percent of 
refugee and 14 percent of host community households 
are in need of livelihood support, with the highest 
percentage among refugee households in West Nile (55 
percent). At district level, the greatest needs for 
livelihood support among refugee households are in 
Moyo (65 percent), Yumbe (60 percent), Arua (57 
percent) and Kyegegwa (53 percent).

27 WFP, UNHCR and OPM. 2017. Analysis of Refugee Vulnerability 
in Uganda 

Regarding the application of livelihood coping 
strategies25, refugees from the DRC and Burundi 
reported sales of more animals (non-productive than 
usual) as well as reduced essential non-food 
expenditures such as education and health. Kyangwali 
settlement recorded the highest percentage (25.2 
percent) of consumption of seed stock held for next 
season as their livelihood coping strategy. 

Ninety-seven percent of host communities and 95 
percent of refugees in northern Uganda reported to be 
engaged in crop production, while only 45 percent of 
host communities and 22 percent of refuges sell part of 
their produce.26 Agriculture is the most commonly 
reported source of livelihoods for refugee (38 percent) 
and host community (84 percent) households in the 30 
days prior to data collection. However, across refugee-
hosting districts agriculture is characterized by low 
production and productivity, high vulnerability to climate 
change and high post-harvest losses.27 

The joint inter-agency MSNA found that 70 percent of 
refugee and 91 percent of host community households 
had access to agricultural land in the most recent 
planting and harvesting season. However, 69 percent in 


South West and 60 percent in Mid West reported that 
land was insufficient to produce food for the entire 
households. 

Out of households who reported having access to 
agricultural land, 39 percent of refugee and 54 percent 
of host community households cited lack of seeds as 
the main reason for being unable to cultivate, followed 
by lack of tools (33 percent for refugee and 38 percent 
for host community households). Further, crop 
diseases such as the cassava mosaic disease, and 
infestations such as the Fall Armyworm present 
additional challenges to food security and income 
generation, as does the lack of adequate animal health 
services. 

For non-farm livelihoods, limited business support 
services, micro-credit and vocational skills training 
opportunities are key barriers to earning an income 
outside of agriculture. Only 2 percent of refugee 
households have managed to obtain salaried 
employment.28 Overall, 13 percent of refugees aged 15 
years and above are classified as self-employed and 
one in five households (20 percent) has at least one 
household member engaged in informal trade and 
services. However, most employment options offer low 
wages. Lack of documentation showing education and 
skills, language and lack of social networks represent 
key barriers to gaining employment for refugees29. 

28 Idem, pg 7 

29 Idem, pg.13 

To stabilize livelihood and overcome the socio-
economic empowerment disconnect, geographic and 
population differences need to be considered in the 
provision of livelihood support. When exploring different 
livelihood strategies, key factors linked to productive 
assets, knowledge, skills and aspirations need to further 
be considered as do market linkages and opportunities. 

Protection: Despite Uganda’s favourable protection 
environment, refugees are faced with numerous 
protection challenges due to the magnitude of 
displacement and growing vulnerabilities, compounded 
by diminishing resources and strained social services in 
refugee-hosting districts. 

Reception, registration and refugee status 
determination 

Limited capacities of border authorities and reception 
staff, as well as shortfalls in coordination among key 
partners create delays and backlogs in registration and 
issuance of documentation. 

In order to reduce the lengthy processing time for 
asylum seekers awaiting refugee status determination 
(RSD), there is a need to strengthen the capacity and 
accelerate the work of the Refugee Eligibility Committee 
(REC), an inter-ministerial body in charge of RSD for 
asylum seekers who fall outside the prima facie 
recognition. The Refugee Appeals Board (RAB) also 
needs support to be able to review on a more regular 
basis the cases of asylum seekers rejected at first 
instance. 

Additional human resources, equipment and better 
Internet connectivity are needed to address delays in 
registration in most locations. When asylum seekers 
and refugees fail to be timely registered, they may be 
unable to access certain services or experience delayed 
service provision. 

Mechanisms and pathways allowing refugees to report 
complaints and receive feedback in the areas of 
reception, verification, registration and RSD are limited 
and need to be strengthened and better coordinated. 

Persons with specific needs 

While almost the 10 per cent of the total refugee 
population in Uganda has been identified to have 
specific needs30 as of June 2018, many more will 
require targeted protection services and support by the 
end of 2020. Among them are unaccompanied and 
separated children, women, children and older persons 
at risk, persons with disabilities and serious medical 
conditions, and persons carrying trauma. Community 
outreach and mobilization need to be further 
strengthened as to enable communities to effectively 
play an active role in their own protection. 

30 Data from proGres v4 and outcomes of most recent PSN 
assessment exercises. 

Psychosocial interventions for trauma survivors require 
significant investments, especially for refugees who 
were directly or indirectly exposed to extreme violence, 
lost family members or witnessed the destruction of 
their homes. 

According to 2018 joint inter-agency MSNA, at the 
national level 22 percent of refugee households 
reported that at least one member was scared or in 
psychological distress, with the highest percentage (46 
percent) in Isingiro district (hosting mostly DRC and 
Burundi refugees). Out of these households, 40 percent 
reported that the family member in psychological 
distress was unable to access psychosocial care. 

Access to justice 

Refugees face significant challenges in accessing 
justice, especially in remote areas where the presence 
of the judiciary and police is limited or non-existent. In 
most settlements the number of police officers is 
inadequate to respond to the needs of an increasing 
population, especially female police officers – which 
represents a barrier for female refugees to come 
forward and report SGBV incidents. Lack or inadequate 
transportation and poor access to communication 
means are additional challenges facing the police 
deployed in refugee settlements across Uganda. 

Coexistence between communities 

Tensions exist between the host communities, long-
term refugees and new arrivals due to competition over 
decreasing resources (firewood, water, land) and the 
real or perceived belief of unequal access to services. 
Inter-ethnic tensions among refugee communities are 
also a concern and reflect the configuration of group 
power back in their countries of origin. Nevertheless, 


conflict-prevention and peace education programmes 
remain significantly under-resourced and require 
substantial investments as part of a strategy to prepare 
refugees to return home in the long run. 

Civilian character of asylum 

There are concerns that combatants from various 
armed groups may enter Uganda through refugee flows, 
compromising the civilian character of asylum and 
refugee settlements and potentially leading to incidents 
of forced recruitment, child abuse, SGBV and inter-
communal tensions. Existing policies and practices on 
separation, internment, demobilization and 
rehabilitation of former combatants need to be further 
strengthened. 

Child Protection 

Children represent 60 percent31 of refugees and asylum 
seekers in Uganda. Before, during and after flight 
refugee children face serious protection risks, including 
family separation, physical, sexual and gender-based 
violence, psychosocial distress, child labour and other 
forms of violence. According to the 2018 joint inter-
agency MSNA, households in both refugee (12 percent) 
and host communities (14 percent) reported having 
children who had experienced violence. As for host 
community households, the highest level of violence 
against children was reported in Isingiro district (30 
percent). 

31 UNHCR Uganda Operation Country Statistics, RIMS, June 2018. 

32 Preliminary report on the Joint Interagency Assessment on 
measures, mechanism and services for protection of women and 
children conducted in refugee settlements in Uganda, 2018 

The 2018 joint inter-agency MSNA highlights teenage 
pregnancy, defilement, child neglect, corporal 
punishment, mistreatment and neglect of fostered 
children as common amongst all population groups32. 
With a weak community child protection system, 
children are struggling to cope and to adapt to the new 
circumstances in the country of asylum. Poor 
psychosocial functioning among children is increasingly 
manifested in behavioural and conduct disorders. 

There are currently 29,295 unaccompanied and 
separated children33 (UASC) in Uganda. The joint inter-
agency MSNA report identified that a higher number of 
refugee households has vulnerable children (orphans, 
unaccompanied, separated) than host community 
households. More host community and refugee 
households in districts hosting South Sudanese 
refugees were identified to have vulnerable children 
than in districts hosting refugees from DRC, Burundi 
and other nationalities. There is limited access to child 
protection services, with 68 percent of refugee and 84 
percent of host community households with vulnerable 
children across Uganda reporting having children in 
need of adequate services34.

34 UNHCR/REACH Joint Multi-Sector Needs Assessment, 2018. 

SGBV 

With significant numbers of women and children, the 
refugee populations in Uganda are highly vulnerable to 
SGBV, including persons with specific needs (PSNs). 

In DRC, as well as in South Sudan, sexual violence has 
been used as a weapon of war, including rape. Many 
have experienced sexual abuse, torture and separation 
from family members before or during flight. 

For SGBV incidents that occurred before or during flight, 
survivors have little or no chance to effectively pursue 
legal redress. Emotional and psychological trauma is 
common among refugees who have experienced 
violence or have witnessed violence perpetrated 
against family or community members. 

SGBV also occurs in Uganda, affecting both new 
refugee arrivals and long-term refugees. In addition to 
the 1,196 SGBV survivors from DRC identified and 
assisted as of June 2018, many more are expected to 
be needing support by the end of 2020 as a result of 
anticipated refugee influxes and improved identification 
and reporting mechanisms. 

Rape ranks as the most prevalent form of SGBV (36 
percent) among refugees from the DRC, followed by 
physical violence (23 percent), psychosocial abuse (18 
percent), forced marriage (6 percent) and sexual 
assault (5 percent). Most of the rape incidents occurred 
in the country of origin and were reportedly perpetrated 
by militia groups. 

Intimate partner violence is the prevailing form of SGVB 
amongst the incidents occurred in Uganda. 

According to 2018 joint inter-agency MSNA, out of 37 
percent of refugee households who self-rated the safety 
and security of their current location as less than good, 
15 percent cited SGBV as a reason for insecurity. The 
highest percentages were reported in Koboko (50 
percent), Kamwenge (29 percent), hosting refugees 
from the DRC. 

One of the contributing factors to SGBV is shift in the 
traditional power balance within households, with an 
increasing number of women becoming the main or sole 
breadwinner at home. Whilst leading to increased 
SGBV within domestic walls, the increasing 
disempowerment of men have also caused them to be 
more exposed to emotional and psychological violence. 

Denial of resources (e.g. food, household items, 
money), limited access to post-primary education and 
livelihood opportunities act as aggravating factors in the 
incidence of SGVB. Scarcity of food remains a key 
cause for intimate partner violence. Women and 
children are at heightened risk of assault when travelling 
to remote and isolated areas for collection of firewood 
and water or walking through communal areas with 
inadequate lighting. 

Although illegal according to Uganda laws, child, early 
and forced marriages are prominent and socially 
accepted among the refugees. It has been reported that 
underage girls are often taken back to South Sudan to 
be married off and return to Uganda only after marriage. 


A growing number of lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender and inter-sex (LGBTI) individuals from 
refugee-producing countries, especially DRC, need 
focussed attention. This category of asylum seekers not 
only are not granted refugee status in Uganda, but also 
face low tolerance and acceptance among the members 
of the public, and hence insecurity. 

Underreporting of SGBV cases remains a major 
concern, due to a variety of factors including fear of 
stigma, shame, family reaction and dissolution, 
perception of SGBV as a private matter, or lack of 
confidence in reporting channels. 

Prevention and response services are not adequate to 
effectively address the protection needs of a growing 
population, with many SGBV survivors relying on 
community structures that often re-victimized them 
instead of serving their interest. 

Delays in accessing justice and limited human and 
financial resources are huge challenges to the provision 
of quality and effective services. 

Shelter, Settlement and NFIs: About 140,000 new 
refugee arrivals from the DRC are expected through to 
2020 will need household NFIs and emergency shelter 
support, as well as accommodation on shelter and 
agriculture plots in settlements. The modality for NFI 
deliveries may transition from in-kind kits to cash-based 
support, depending on the market economies and other 
context-specific parameters. 

In order to facilitate the smooth relocation of new 
refugee arrivals from border entry points through to 
household shelter plots, the existing transit and 
reception centres will need ongoing construction 
maintenance, repairs, potential expansion and 
installation of energy-saving stoves. 

The existing refugee settlements require detailed plot 
mapping, led by the Ministry of Lands, Housing and 
Urban Development (MLHUD) and OPM, with 
involvement of Sub-County Area Land Committees 
(ALCs), in order to produce cadastral survey plans that 
are aligned with the local area physical development 
plans. These blueprints will inform the spatial redesign 
process, where necessary, to maximise sustainable 
land use, protect environmentally sensitive areas and 
improve livelihood opportunities for both refugees and 
hosts. 

The allocation of productive land for agriculture is 
essential to promoting resilient incomes and self-
sustaining food security. To ensure a harmonised 
approach, any new settlement should be planned and 
mapped in accordance with the same land use 
management principles. 

The 2018 joint inter-agency MSNA results revealed that, 
on average, 21 percent of refugee and 33 percent of 
host community households do not have access to a 

market within walking distance. Furthermore, 38 
percent of refugee and 50 percent of host community 
households reported facing problems accessing 
markets to buy or sell agricultural products or livestock 
in the last 30 days prior to the survey35. While 
recognising that “refugees’ integration into the local 
economy is a long-term process”36, it is essential that 
settlement planning urgently take into account 
measures to address these physical limitations, 
including by allocating strategic locations for new 
marketplaces and creating or upgrading access routes 
to existing markets. 

35 UNHCR/REACH Joint Multi-Sector Needs Assessment, 2018.

and host communities in Northern Uganda,” Resilience Analysis 
Report No. 12, 2018. 

 

In some refugee settlements in the West Nile, there is a 
need to focus on the continued relocation of refugees 
from flood-prone areas to higher ground, in coordination 
with OPM and negotiation with local land owners. This 
reality is reflected in the joint inter-agency MSNA results 
where Koboko and Lamwo districts recorded the 
highest percentage of refugee households reporting 
flooding, 54 percent and 42 percent respectively. 

The extensive road infrastructure within all refugee 
settlements will require ongoing maintenance and 
upgrades to increase their all-year durability through 
wet seasons. Investments in road networks 
improvements have the potential to create jobs for both 
refugees and host communities through a cash-for-work 
scheme. 

Gaps in solar street light coverage and institutional 
rainwater harvesting will need to be addressed so as to 
increase settlement security and provide more water for 
production. 

Since mid-2016, no countrywide in-depth shelter or NFI 
needs assessments have been conducted in the 
refugee settlements. Furthermore, there is no detailed 
database on shelter conditions per population or per 
settlement, nor is it known the total numbers that require 
urgent repairs or semi-permanent upgrades. 

Nonetheless, the 2018 joint inter-agency MSNA is able 
to provide an approximate indication of broad sector 
concerns that necessitate further investigation and 
analysis. A total of 73 percent of all refugee households 
surveyed claimed that their shelter is prone to leaking 
when it rains. In addition, South Sudanese refugees in 
the West Nile reported to possess fewer NFIs per 
household in comparison to the Congolese and 
Burundians in the Southwest. A door-to-door household 
NFI survey in all settlements would be key to provide a 
deeper understanding of unmet NFI needs across the 
operation – to be followed by a targeted distribution of 
missing items. It is a priority for the sector to gather 
baseline information and data in order to ascertain 
individual needs and to prioritize targeted shelter/NFI 
interventions. 

Despite a lack of comprehensive data, it is evident that 
all refugee population groups continue to live in 


emergency shelters longer than advisable and many 
PSN families are yet to receive labour support to 
upgrade to semi-permanent construction. 

The sector will seek to uphold a fair and consistent 
approach to the design and implementation of semi-
permanent shelters, incorporating the most 
environmentally-friendly and contextually-appropriate 
materials to the extent possible. More efforts are 
needed for shelter partners to adhere to inter-agency 
minimum standards such as termite protection for 
timber or bamboo and the overall shelter dimensions, 
and to strengthen coordination with the WASH, Energy 
and Environment, and Livelihoods and Resilience 
sectors in order to achieve a holistic approach to 
refugee protection and management. 

WASH: On average, access to water in refugee hosting 
sub-counties stood at 16 litres per person per day (l/p/d) 
as of June 2018. In settlements hosting refugees from 
the DRC and Burundi, water supply ranged from below 
10 to 15 l/p/d for both refugees and host communities. 

Most water infrastructure developed in the settlements 
is temporary, with technical and financial feasibility 
limitations. Unit cost of supplying water is high due to 
operational inefficiencies coupled with reliance on costly 
water trucking to fill a 12 percent gap in the daily water 
demand in the settlements. 

Provision of water has largely focused on water demand 
for domestic use, although refugees continued to resort 
to domestic water supply for brick production and to 
mud plaster their homes. In 2017, the construction of 
valley tanks in Kyaka II and Rwamwanja settlements 
was an attempt to provide water supply for productive 
uses, but huge inadequacies have compromised the 
success of these initiatives. 

There is complete lack of integrated water resource 
management, with developments in the settlements 
often failing to consider the larger catchment area for 
planning and programming. The environment is heavily 
impacted by over-reliance on groundwater without 
monitoring behaviour of benevolent aquifers in most 
refugee-hosting districts, absence of deliberate 
catchment conservation and rehabilitation initiatives. 

According to the 2018 joint inter-agency MSNA, 79 
percent of refugee and host community households own 
a single family latrine, with over 55 percent of refugee 
households reporting child males and females as 
unable to access the latrine due to their young age. 

In settlements hosting refugees from the DRC and 
Burundi, instances of hard ground conditions and 
waterlogged areas are aggravating factors in low-level 
family latrine coverage among vulnerable families. In 
general, the life span of ordinary family latrines is 
shorter than optimal due to the inadequate provision of 
construction materials. While 3,017 communal latrines 
exist in public spaces, 35 percent of schools, markets, 
food distribution centres and health facilities still lack 
institutional latrines. 

Across the entire refugee response there are only three 
faecal sludge treatment units and no vacuum truck to 
adequately manage excreta disposal. Solid waste at 
household level is rudimentarily treated as soil 
conditioner while markets and communal areas lack an 
organized management system to segregate, collect, 
dispose and/or reuse waste. Efforts to convert 
sanitation wastes into value are very limited and include 
biogas pilots and briquette making. 

The lack of a harmonized and context-specific 
behaviour change communication strategy for hygiene 
awareness initiatives continued to slow down adoption 
of positive hygiene practise among refugees. This is 
further worsened by limited provision of hygiene 
supplies, with 48 percent of refugee households 
reporting lack of soap during the joint inter-agency 
MSNA. Of them, 58 percent cited financial constraints 
as a reason for lacking soap, with the highest 
percentage in Mid West (79 percent) and South West 
(69 percent). 

Awareness on handwashing appears to be relatively 
high among refugee households as per the 2018 joint 
inter-agency MSNA, with 77 percent reporting washing 
their hands after defecating, 76 percent before eating 
and 56 percent when hands are dirty. However, more 
efforts are needed to improve hygiene related to food 
preparation and child feeding. According to the joint 
inter-agency MSNA, only 37 percent of refugee 
households reported washing hands before cooking 
and 16 percent before child feeding and after cleaning 
a baby. 

There is a need to harmonize approaches in the 
implementation of WASH programmes in the 
settlements and refugee-hosting districts. Service 
delivery modalities in the settlements are structured 
around humanitarian principles and do not take into 
account tariff policy or transition plans for operation and 
maintenance. It is essential that WASH initiatives are in 
line and coordinated with District Development Plans 
(DDPs) and Catchment Managements Plans (CMPs). 
There is also a need for a shared knowledge 
management platform to help partners deliver services 
in line with government frameworks and priorities. 
Enforcement of statutory policies and regulations from 
Ministry of Water and Environment remains weak. 

Host communities 

The population of Ugandan communities hosting DRC 
refugees is estimated at 1.34 million, dispersed across 
15 sub-counties in South and Mid West, as well as in 
the capital Kampala. In particular, communities living in 
close proximity of the settlements have been heavily 
affected by the ongoing and mass arrivals of new 
refugees in terms of resource sharing and access to 
services, but are also those with the greatest potential 
to benefit from development interventions in refugee-
hosting areas in the long run. 

In the education sector, a gross enrolment rate of 120 
per cent at primary level shows incidences of over and 
under-age enrolment among the host community at a 


national level, while an 18 per cent low enrolment rate 
at secondary level indicates critical gaps. 

The recent influx from the DRC has placed significant 
pressure on forest resources especially around Kyaka II 
and Kyangwali settlements. The MNSA shows that 93 
percent host community households depend on fuel 
wood energy for cooking, with only 20 percent of 
households reporting use of energy saving stoves. 

The MSNA revealed that 17 percent of host community 
households were categorized as people in need in the 
health sector. Among them, 44 percent reported lack of 
drugs at health facilities as the biggest challenge in 
accessing health services for those who sought 
treatment but were unable to receive it. 

The MSNA found that 91 percent of host community 
households had access to agricultural land in the most 
recent planting and harvesting season, but 54 percent 
was unable to cultivate to the lack of seeds.

Response Strategy and Priorities

Overal Strategy 

The Uganda 2019-2020 RRP serves as the joint 
strategy setting, needs assessment and resource 
mobilisation tool for all UN and NGO partners of the 
refugee response. 

The Uganda RRP is consistent with the following 
national and international frameworks: 

- The Constitution of Uganda; 
- The Uganda Refugee Act and Regulations; 
- The 1951 Refugee Convention, and the 1969 
OAU Refugee Convention; 
- IGAD regional declarations on refugee matters. 


Strategic objectives 

Under the leadership and coordination of the 
Government, the Uganda 2019-2020 RRP aims at 
achieving the following objectives, in line with the 
Uganda Multi-Year Multi-Partner Protection and 
Solutions Strategy (2016 -2020): 

Strategic objective 1: Through to 2020, Uganda’s 
asylum space is maintained, equal and unhindered 
access to territory is preserved and the government’s 
emergency preparedness and response capacity is 
progressively strengthened. 

Strategic objective 2: The Government of Uganda 
owns protection processes that promote the full 
enjoyment of rights, and international protection 
standards throughout the displacement cycle are 
efficient and fair. 

Strategic objective 3: By 2020, the refugee response 
paradigm in Uganda has progressively shifted from care 
and maintenance to inclusion and self-reliance through 
development of individual capacities and the promotion 
of a conducive environment for livelihoods 
opportunities. 

Strategic objective 4: By 2020, refugees progressively 
benefit from provision of inclusive basic social services, 
including health, education, child protection, water and 
sanitation, provided by national authorities in refugee 
hosting districts. 

Strategic objective 5: By 2020, refugees are well on 
their path to access durable solutions. They are either 
able to return voluntarily to their countries of origin, or 
have found third country solutions, or start attaining 
socio-economic opportunities similar to hosting 
communities in Uganda, including ability to exercise 
their full range of rights. 

Priority outcomes 

Partners and sectors will be guided by the following 
priority outcomes for planning and programming – 
which will also serve as criteria for prioritization in case 
of austerity and severe under-funding. 

1. Refugee protection: All newly arriving refugees and 
asylum seekers in Uganda will have access to 
territory and protection, including strengthened 
refugee status determination processes, biometric 
registration and documentation. The Uganda model, 
including the non-encampment policy, freedom of 
movement and right to work for refugees, will 
continue to provide a dignified refugee protection 
environment. 


Across all sectors, refugees must be assisted with 
respect to age, gender and diversity considerations, 
catering for specific needs. Protection from sexual 
exploitation and abuse (PSEA) must be ensured, 
and there is zero tolerance in the refugee response 
towards this. An inter-agency Feedback, Referral, 
and Resolution Mechanism will be accessible to all 
refugees and host communities. Prevention and 
response to SGBV and child protection constitute 
major cross-cutting protection outcomes. 

2. Emergency response: All newly arriving refugees 
and asylum seekers in Uganda will benefit from life-
saving basic needs assistance interventions. This 
includes prioritization of operations supporting their 
initial installation in refugee settlements and/or in 
urban areas. Preparedness for higher than 
anticipated refugee influxes, and preparedness for 
related health emergency risks such as cholera or 
Ebola for example, remain priorities. 
3. Education: In a situation where primary and 
secondary facilities and resources lag far behind the 
overall need, and many education indicators are still 



in red, education must be prioritised. Education lays 
the foundation for the future prosperity and 
development of refugee (in asylum or upon their 
voluntary return home when possible) and Ugandan 
hosting communities. Education interventions 
support a set of related outcomes, such as child 
protection, prevention of SGBV, social cohesion and 
livelihoods, and therefore have a strong multiplier 
effect. 
4. Environment: Hosting communities, field 
monitoring, and expert studies have identified 
environmental protection and restoration as a 
priority, and environmental degradation at significant 
scale as a threat. The rapid growth of the refugee 
population in Uganda has led to a surge in demand 
for natural resources, including wood fuel, 
construction material, land for agriculture and 
groundwater along with an increase in waste 
production (e.g. faecal sludge, solid waste). 


The most visible and immediate impact is loss of 
forest cover and vegetation in refugee-hosting 
areas. Across all sectors, these effects need to be 
prevented and mitigated, for example through the 
use of alternative energy solutions for cooking fuel, 
and increased re/afforestation measures, among 
others. This issue could negatively affect social 
cohesion and peaceful co-existence between 
refugees and hosting communities. 

5. Livelihoods: With the understanding that the RRP 
focusses on the immediate and transition phase of 
assisting refugees, desired priority outcomes are the 
improvement of livelihoods and access to short-term 
opportunities for refugees and hosting populations, 
especially in areas such as agricultural production, 
afforestation measures, and labour intensive public 
works. 


The aim is not necessarily to achieve sustainability, 
which is not a realistic outcome for an RRP, but an 
injection of short-term immediate livelihood 
opportunities. The outcome, benefiting both 
refugees and host community members, will have a 
multiplier effect on other desired outcomes, such as 
food security, social cohesion, reduction of aid 
dependency, and productive engagement of the 
youth. 

6. Urban refugees: As the Uganda refugee model 
allows for freedom of movement of refugees, some 
have chosen to reside in urban areas rather than 
settlements, while others commute between 
settlements and urban areas. While the situation of 
refugees in Kampala is well understood, this is not 
the case for refugees in other towns and cities of 
Uganda. The 2019-2020 RRP will prioritize better 
assessments of refugees in urban areas, more 
engagement with municipal actors, and enhanced 
support to refugees and hosting communities in 
these areas, resources permitting. 


 

 

Priority modalities 

Across all sectors, to achieve the above strategic 
objectives and priority outcomes, the following 
modalities will take priority: 

1. Labour-intensive activities: As feasible and 
appropriate, opportunities for labour intensive works 
for larger numbers of unskilled, and skilled, refugees 
and host community members should be prioritized, 
over short and longer term. Among others, this may 
include public works, environmental restoration, 
community outreach, and stimulation of agricultural 
production, including value chain creation. 
2. Cash-based interventions and connectivity: 
Market feasibility permitting, opportunities to 
transform in-kind assistance to cash-based 
assistance should be seized. The injection of cash, 
through unconditional multi-purpose, and conditional 
cash-based interventions will have multiplier effects 
on food security, social cohesion, reduction of aid 
dependency, and productive engagement of the 
youth, among others. 


The development of the Minimum Expenditure 
Basket (MEB) tool will ultimately support the cost 
efficiency and cost effectiveness, and pave the way 
for coherent multi-purpose cash programming and 
delivery. The establishment of a common platform 
for cash transfers will be pursued. 

Partners will develop deeper partnerships with the 
private sector, such as financial service providers, 
mobile network operators, and other connectivity 
actors. This will result in an improvement of the 
necessary infrastructure for data delivery from cell 
towers to devices. In addition to helping increase 
refugees’ access to financial services, connectivity 
and related interventions will serve the entire 
response, for example for biometric registration and 
verification systems, communication with 
communities, access to information and adoption of 
innovative digital tools and solutions that have 
positive impact on protection outcomes. 

Activities will leverage the skills and capacities of 
communities to engage in and support a connected 
environment. Enhanced connectivity will also cover 
Ugandan hosting populations, supporting an 
inclusive approach. 

3. Capacity building for Government service 
providers and local actors: To achieve integrated 
social service delivery, the capacity of district 
authorities and line Ministries is a pre-requisite. The 
humanitarian response should gradually move away 
from parallel service provision and seize every 
opportunity to involve districts and line Ministries. 
The capacity of national NGOs will be further 
strengthened. As far as possible, national NGOs 
should be given greater responsibilities. 
4. Conflict-sensitive programming: Interventions 
across all sectors must be sensitive to drivers of 
conflict and tensions, as to ensure that they not only 



achieve their desired outcomes, but also contribute 
to social cohesion among refugee communities, and 
between refugees and host communities. 
Interventions must de-escalate, and not trigger 
additional tensions. Meaningful consultations with 
communities on programme/project design are 
essential. 


Across the response, the need for joint and coordinated 
assessments and in-depht thematic studies remains 
crucial to ensure a better understanding of the needs of 
refugee and host communities, to identify gaps in the 
response and draw attention to issues requiring strategy 
adjustments and innovation. 

Monitoring and oversight 

Building on ongoing initiatives, an enhanced monitoring 
framework will be established to assess the 
performance of this RRP and to ensure progress 
against the targets set by partners at the start of the 
planning process. 

Sector Co-leads, UNHCR and OPM will regularly reach 
out to RRP partners to gather information and data for 
RRP progress reports, including through sector activity 
mapping matrixes (5Ws). Systematic progress reporting 
against the indicators in the RRP results framework will 
be a requirement for all partners. 

RRP partners also have an obligation to participate to 
existing coordination mechanisms at national, district 
and local level to help improve service delivery and 
address operational challenges. Partners are also 
required to regularly report on funding received against 
this plan as to demonstrate their contribution to the 
Uganda refugee model, and to support advocacy and 
resource mobilization. 

The ultimate goal of deploying a robust monitoring 
framework is ensuring transparency and accountability, 
avoiding duplications and re-adjusting the response 
whenever inefficacies and gaps are identified. 

Strengthening Livelihoods and Resilience 

Whilst being mainly a humanitarian plan, this RRRP 
also includes a transition element towards sustainable 
refugee response programming in Uganda. As such, 
this plan contributes to applying the Comprehensive 
Refugee Response Framework (CRRF) in Uganda, , 
alongside interventions carried out by Government 
institutions within the framework of the National 
Development Plan (NDP II) and of Government-led 
sector transition plans for refugee-hosting areas, 
supported by multilateral and bilateral development 
partners. 

The scope of the 2019-2020 Uganda RRRP includes 
refugee protection and assistance for new refugee 
arrivals and long-term refugees, as well as resilience 
programming for refugees and hosting communities. 
Resilience interventions take place at three levels: 1) 
individual or household level; 2) community level; and 
3) system level. The focus of resilience interventions in 
this RRP is on supporting national systems to achieve 
integrated social service delivery for both refugees and 
hosting communities. 

Government sector response plans for refugee hosting 
areas will provide the planning and programming 
framework to respond to the needs of refugee and host 
communities in those sectors, including Education, 
Health & Nutrition, and WASH. At the time of 
developing this RRRP, the Education Response Plan 
(ERP) was the first government sector plan of this kind 
already launched launched and the Jobs and 
Livelihoods Response Plan was underway. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


Planned Response for 2019 and 2020 

 

 

Sector strategies are guided by the overall strategy and operational priorities, laying out the approach and measures 
that the sectors envisage to address identified needs, with a focus on priority needs. In sectors with existing government 
response plans (Education, Health, and Water), the response and priorities are aligned to those plans. 

 

In addition, the response activities and priorities are targeting Congolese refugees, as well as refugees from Ethiopia, 
Eritrea, Rwanda, Somalia and Sudan who live in protracted exile in Uganda for the past three decades. All urban 
refugees are targeted, including refugees from the DRC who represent the largest urban refugee population.

Background and Achievements

Overview

The United Republic of Tanzania hosts some 83,994 
refugees and asylum-seekers from the DRC. In January 
2018, there was a surge in the number of asylum-
seekers from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) 
arriving in Tanzania via small fishing boats. However, 
most Congolese asylum seekers cross Tanzania 
through land border entry points along the Burundi-
Tanzania border due to the high transportation costs 
when crossing Lake Tanganyika as well as difficulties in 
accessing the shore on the Tanzanian side of the lake. 
The majority of refugees and asylum-seekers live in 
Nyarugusu refugee camp, in north western Tanzania, 
and a small population of about 60 refugees are hosted 
in urban centers, mainly in Dar es Salaam. 

The political context in Tanzania continues to evolve. 
Since 2017, restrictions on access to territory and 
asylum have increased. All 19 border entry and 
reception points for Congolese as well as Burudnian 
asylum seekers were closed between March 2017 and 
July 2018. Currently, all asylum-seekers arriving in 
Tanzania must undergo individual refugee status 
determination (RSD) procedures which requires asylum 
seekers to be assessed by the National Eligibility 
Committee (NEC). 

Despite an unpredictable protection environment and 
limited capacity and resources to stabilise and 
strengthen existing programmes, RRP partners in 
Tanzania continue to provide critical protection and 
humanitarian assistance to persons of concern. 

From 2012 to September 2018, Tanzania submitted 
28,950 Congolese refugees for resettlement to the 
United States, Canada and other resettlement countries 
under the multi-year resettlement plans of action, of 
which, 19,160 refugees were submitted under the 2015 
5-year Group Resettlement Programme to the United 
States. Since 2015, Tanzania has consistently achieved 
its resettlement submission quotas with high approval 
rates by resettlement countries averaging 98.7%. 

The Government of Tanzania and UNHCR are currently 
using proGres version 4, UNHCR’s latest registration, 
identity management and caseload management tool. 
Increased confidence in refugee registration systems 
will not only speed up registration but also facilitate 
better access to identity documents and services for 
refugees. 

In 2019-20, RRP partners will prioritise interventions 
aimed at supporting and ensuring access to asylum and 
protection for persons of concern, while also continuing 
to implement durable solutions, improving the 
livelihoods and resilience of refugees and host 
communities. Strengthening the linkages between 
humanitarian assistance and development planning, 
particularly in the area of resilience, is another key 
priority.

Needs and Vulnerabilities37

37 Need analysis also include information for the total of the refugee population in the country, which stands at 335,298 refugees and asylum-seekers 
and is compromised of 250,590 Burundians and 83,994 Congolese, as well as refugees from other countries (620). The majority of refugees and 
asylum-seekers live in three refugee camps in north western Tanzania: Nyarugusu, Nduta and Mtendeli. 

 

The political situation in the DRC remains heightened 
and electoral preparations, which are scheduled before 
the end of 2018, are likely to exacerbate political 
tensions and trigger a new influx. However, the closure 

of all border entry points across north western Tanzania 
has made access to territory more difficult and could 
result in a large number of asylum seekers from the 


DRC crossing into Tanzania via Lake Tanganyinka by 
boat. 

There are approximately 21,122 Congolese asylum 
seekers pending refugee status determination (RSD). 
The current RSD process needs strengthening, 
especially in terms of capacity building. New 
administrative instructions further restricting refugees’ 
movement both inside and outside the camps have also 
severely limited refugees’ coping mechanisms. 

Protection: Due to the protracted refugee situation, 
restrictive policies and chronic underfunding, the 
refugee population in Tanzania remains highly 
dependent on humanitarian assistance, exposing many 
refugees and asylum seekers to a variety of protection 
risks. The restrictive approach taken by the Government 
of Tanzania for much of 2018 has seen the closure of 
all border entry points for Congolese and Burundians 
asylum seekers as well as a high rejection rate of 
refugee claims by the NEC. In June 2018, 100% of 
Congolese asylum claims from people fleeing conflict in 
eastern DRC were rejected by the NEC.. A lack of 
official identity documents has also made it difficult for 
refugees to access basic services. Delays in resolving 
registration issues also continue to negatively 
undermine current protection initiatives. Although 
persons with specific needs (PSNs) in Nyarugusu camp 
continued to receive targeted assistance and support, 
the population continues to face many challenges, 
including discrimination, marginalization, stigmatization 
as well as a limited capacity to access essential 
services. A lack of transitional shelters with adapted 
WASH facilities for PSNs is another challenge. In 
addition, strengthening the delivery of essential services 
such as adequate health care, physical and 
psychosocial support, material assistance and referrals 
through community structures and services provided by 
RRP partners, is needed. 

Child Protection: Child protection remains a high 
operational priority: more than the half of the total 
refugee population in Tanzania is under the age of 18. 
Refugee children face serious protection risks such as 
separation from families, psychosocial distress, abuse 
and exploitation, including child labour and sexual 
exploitation. Unaccompanied and separated children 
(UASC) remain the most vulnerable, especially girls 
who are at risk of SGBV and early and forced marriages. 
An inadequate number of child friendly spaces (CFS) 
and lack of basic play and learning materials persists. 
Limited educational opportunities, vocational skills 
training and job opportunities are also lacking, which 
may lead to several protection risks as well as negative 
coping mechanisms such as drug abuse and 
transactional and survival sex. 

While restrictions on movement have been slightly 
relaxed, some parents have no choice but to leave 
children unattended, which can result in abuse and 
exploitation. In some cases, women who are the main 
entitlement card holders bring their children to food 
distribution centres so that they can help them carry the 
rations back to their homes. As a result, the number of 
children failing to go to school has increased by up to 
80% with some walking as far as 13 km to the food 
distribution centre, exceeding the SPHERE minimum 
standard of 10km. 

As of November 2018, 862 unregistered Congolese and 
Burundian children are reported to be living in the 
camps without access to critical services and 
assistance, including food, CRIs and education. 
Advocacy for their registration continues. 

RRP Child Protection partners continue to monitor 
children in foster care although their capacity is severely 
overstretched. There is a pronounced need for RRP 
Child Protection partners to invest more time in 
understanding the impact split decisions have on the 
psychosocial wellbeing of children so as to better 
support them with more targeted psychosocial care. In 
the absence of such care, this distress is likely to have 
long term implications on their overall physical and 
psychological wellbeing. 

SGBV: SGBV remains a significant protection concern 
in the operation. Some key risk factors include firewood 
collection, alcoholism, conflict around multiple 
marriages and abandonment, congested shelters, lack 
of accessible and quality education as well as limited 
income generating activities. Intimate partner violence 
remains as the highest category in all refugee camps in 
the country, accounting for approximately 68% of 
reported SGBV incidents among Congolese and 
Burundian refugees. Engagement with men and boys is 
ongoing although this requires strengthening through 
strategic awareness raising activities, including 
Engaging Men through Accountable Practices (EMAP). 
Continued resource constraints and lack of available 
opportunities for gainful employment will likely lead to 
an increase in early marriage and negative coping 
mechanisms such as alcohol and drug abuse. More 
refugee women than men experience violence at home, 
making this a significant safety concern. Refugees in 
the three camps link incidents of domestic violence to 
stress over lack of access to work for food. 

Education: Congolese refugee children comprise 35% 
(52,214) of the total school-age population. The current 
school-age population in the three camps of Nyarugusu, 
Nduta and Mtendeli hosting Congolese and Burundian 
refugees is 49.5% (150,071) of the total number of 
refugee population, of which 49% (73,913) are female 
and 51% are male (76,158). On average, a total of 81% 
school-aged children are enrolled in primary school. 
One of the main challenges in the education sector is 
school drop-out rates, which increased from 3.5% in 
2016 to 6.1% in 2017. Moreover, 71% of households 
with school-aged children have boys who are in enrolled 
in school compared with 66% of girls. Children drop out 
of school for a number of reasons, including hunger 
which makes it difficult for them to concentrate in 
lessons. A shortage of classrooms, uniforms and 
teaching and reference materials are other challenges. 
In Nyarugusu camp where most Congolese refugees 
reside, an additional 210 classrooms are required. A 
lack motivation to continue learning due to limited higher 
education opportunities persists. A lack of menstrual 
hygiene kits has also prevented girls from attending 


school. On average, less than 30% of secondary school 
teachers and 65% of basic education teachers in the 
refugee camps are professionally trained. Capacity 
building for camp-based teachers is currently underway. 

Tanzania’s refugee policy supports the principle of 
education for repatriation and the country of origin 
curriculum is taught in all schools across the camps. 
However, improved engagement with the Ministry of 
Education in both the DRC and Burundi is required to 
support refugee schools and teachers, provide quality 
assurance, issue updated teaching and reference 
materials and conduct assessments, examinations and 
certification. 

A lack of qualified special education teachers as well as 
learning and reference materials means that children 
with learning difficulties have to attend regular schools. 
The encampment policy also restricts children with 
special education needs from accessing public schools 
which cater to their needs outside the camps. 

Moreover, the current government policy on 
constructing permanent structures has meant that some 
children have to study under the trees. Semi-permanent 
structures constructed under exceptional permission 
will need to be upgraded to permanent structures once 
more funding becomes available. 

WASH: Continued strategic investments to improve 
water supply have borne fruit. Water supply in the three 
camps is now above the SPHERE minimum standard of 
20l/p/day. Water supply networks are also more reliable 
and efficient following the drilling of additional boreholes 
and several backup pumps and installation of solar-
powered pumping systems. 

However, major gaps in sanitation and hygiene persists. 
The quantity of soap distributed remains low at 
250g/person/month instead of the SPHERE minimun 
standard of 450g/person/month and 700 
g/person/month for menstruating women. The 
construction of durable and dignified family latrines is 
still a significant gap: only 42% of households have 
family latrines in all camps. Currently, a severe shortage 
of plastic sheeting has also created a backlog in the 
decommissioning of shared latrines across the camps, 
which may lead to increased public health and 
protection risks especially during the rainy season. 

In addition, sanitation coverage and handwashing 
practice in schools vary widely and a significant number 
of schools still need to be brought up to standard with 
additional investments in latrine construction as well as 
innovative child-to-child hygiene promotion 
programmes. 

Environment and Energy: The use of natural 
resources, including water and wood fuel for cooking, 
not only leads to environmental degradation but also 
gives rise to serious protection risks and increased 
tensions between refugee and host communities. In 
order for energy and environment interventions to be 
sustainable, access to alternative energy sources need 
to be strengthened while also making more efficient use 
of the ones at hand. 

Firewood is still the main source of cooking fuel for 95% 
of refugee households. However, as firewood is not 
readily available in the camps, refugees have to search 
for firewood in nearby host community land, which can 
fuel tensions between both groups. On average, it takes 
refugees over two hours to get to firewood harvesting 
sites and a further two hours to collect firewood. 
Moreover, the encampment policy has exacerbated 
protection risks women and children face. Although 
refugees are not allowed to leave the camp, women and 
children in particular do so in search of firewood. This 
has resulted in an increase in the number of refugee and 
asylum seekers arrested and detained. 

Scaling up sustainable and alternative sources of fuel 
while supporting income-generating activities with a 
view towards increasing purchasing power, is also a 
priority. Wood fuel plantations, agroforestry, 
beekeeping and reforestation programmes will not only 
serve as measures for environmental conservation but 
also alternative livelihoods for refugees and the host 
community. 

Improving water and river conservation is important, as 
well as other shared natural resources, by both 
refugees and host communities through awareness 
raising campaigns, tree planting (including but not 
limited to fast growing species for firewood and water 
friendly species) as well as demarcation of river banks 
and water sources. The protection of the natural 
environment is a shared interest and obligation of both 
refugees and host communities. It is therefore 
imperative that both communities continue to peacefully 
co-exist and resolve any differences that might arise 
through conflict resolution meetings. 

Shelter and Core Relief Items: More than 50% of 
refugees and asylum-seekers across the three camps 
continue to live in dilapidated emergency shelters and 
tents for an extended period of time leading to 
unacceptable living conditions. As a result, households 
are forced to face harsh weather conditions during the 
rainy season, which exposes refugees, and PSNs in 
particular, to various health risks and also impedes the 
delivery of much needed services. 

More funding is needed to address the current gap and 
bolster innovative initiatives such as the community-
based shelter project. Although this initiative has 
reduced shelter construction costs and increased 
community participation, progress has been slowed by 
the ongoing voluntary repatriation exercise. There is an 
urgent need to re-structure the camps to factor in the 
spaces and structures left behind by returnees. A 
shortage of adequate land to accommodate new 
arrivals from the DRC in Nyarugusu as well as a lack of 
funds to develop a new site is another challenge. 

Due to funding shortfalls, there has not been a general 
distribution of core relief items (CRIs) since 2015. As a 
result, a serious shortage of supplies, including soap, 
water containers, cooking utensils, mats, and blankets 
remains. In addition, lack of sanitary materials for 
women and girls poses substantial health and 
protection risks for these groups. Insufficient food-


related items such as cooking utensils can also 
contribute to increased food insecurity and malnutrition 
as refugees sell their rations to replenish CRIs. 

Health and Nutrition: The mortality rates among both 
population groups have been maintained within the 
SPHERE minimum standard of <1/1,000 
population/month for the crude mortality rate and 
<3/1,000 population/month for the under-five mortality 
rate. The risk of increasing mortality remains 
significantly high due to the infectious disease burden, 
high rates of malnutrition and anaemia among children, 
low birth weight and preterm deliveries, and inadequate 
WASH and shelter facilities. There are also major gaps 
in the health services currently available in the camps, 
including the quality and quantity of staff, poor 
infrastructure, limited supplies of essential drugs and 
equipment. The lack of a Comprehensive Emergency 
Obstetric and Newborn Care (CEmONC) facility in 
Nduta is another challenge, which puts additional strain 
on the nearby district hospital in Kibondo. 

Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) rates remain below 5% 
in all three camps. Both stunting and anaemia remain 
alarmingly high due to multiple factors such as cuts to 
the general food distribution, inappropriate use of food 
rations, mothers not allocating enough time to prepare 
food and feed their children, high morbidity burden and 
poor WASH and shelter conditions. The relationship 
between reduced rations and malnutrition remains 
unclear and further analysis is needed to assess the 
underlying reasons behind malnutrition in the camps. 

There is a critical need to improve health service 
provision by better equipping the various health facilities 
and ensuring there is a sufficient supply of qualified 
staff. A dedicated operating theatre for obstetric 
emergencies in Nduta is a major priority as well as 
additional isolation facilities. Life-saving equipment 
such as ambulances, incubators, paediatric vital sign 
monitors, automated external defibrillators and x-ray 
machines are also needed. A continuous supply of 
essential drugs and increased psychosocial health 
services are other priorities. Inadequate infrastructure 
for supplementary feeding activities is another 
challenge. As a result, pregnant and lactating women 
and children have to walk long distances to access 
medical services. Malaria remains the main cause of 
morbidity among children under five across all three 
camps, accounting for 30% of morbidity in Nduta and 
25% in Nyarugusu and Mtendeli. 

There is a need to conduct further assessments to 
ensure reproductive health and safety considering the 
high birth rates and low contraceptive use rates. 
Although maternal mortality rate is lower than in the host 
community, findings from recent maternal deaths 
confirm the need for more investments in capacity 
training and service quality. The proportion of first-time 
antenatal care (ANC) visits during the first trimester is 
also low (31%) with complete ANC coverage standing 
at 65%. As such, increased health promotion and 
community awareness to improve social perceptions of 
reproductive health services need to be enhanced. 

Cultural factors continue to exacerbate high levels of 
stigma and low rates of HIV service buy-in, particularly 
among adolescents and young people. There is a need 
to improve community awareness, adolescent and 
youth friendly HIV service provision and strengthen 
referral mechanisms. 

Food security: Food assistance is provided to all 
refugees living in Nyarugusu, Nduta and Mtendeli 
through general food distributions (GFD) and 
supplementary feeding programmes (SFP). 

As of October 2018, food rations have risen to 100% of 
the recommended kcal with 100% of rations maintained 
for supplementary feeding programme beneficiaries. 
Rations for new arrivals, at the beginning of 2018, 
repatriating refugees and hospital inpatients were 
maintained at 100% of full entitlements. 

The joint UNHCR and WFP 2017 community and 
household surveillance assessment indicated a stable 
food consumption score (FCS) but a significant increase 
in the coping strategy index (CSI), which suggested that 
households were at risk of further deterioration in food 
security status unless there were improvements in 
ration entitlements. A post-distribution monitoring 
(PDM) in March 2018 showed deterioration in all key 
outcome indicators. Dietary diversity, which is low 
across all camps, dropped below 4.0 for the first time in 
2018. The May 2018 PDM showed improvement in a 
number of food security indicators: Dietary diversity 
increased to 4.2 from an average of 3.7 and 4.0 (March 
PDM 2018 and August 2017 CHS respectively), CSI 
decreased from 12.4 to 12.2 and the number of 
households with acceptable food consumption scores 
increased from 54.8% to 69.5%. This trend, which is 
associated with improvements in food rations and 
seasonality factors, highlights the importance of 
maintaining ration entitlements, especially during the 
lean season. 

Chronic underfunding has resulted in inadequate or 
insufficient waiting areas, leaving refugees exposed to 
congestion and adverse weather conditions during 
distributions. Refugees also have to walk long distances 
and spend more time collecting food during GFD and 
SFP because these centres are located far away from 
their homes. 

Host communities 

The Nyarugusu refugee camp is located in the Kigoma 
Region.The refugee camp represents a sizeable portion 
of the population and economic activities associated 
with it and the immediate surrounding villages are 
outnumbered by the camp. 

Years of refugee presence and that of the humanitarian 
community have left these districts with a mixed legacy 
of economic development and natural resource 
depletion. Some members from the host community 
have gained livelihoods, while others have lost them, 
depending on the location, type of work they are 
engaged in and socio-economic status at the onset of 


the influx. There is an operational weekly common 
market in Nyarugusu, which creates opportunities for 
refugee and host community interaction and positive 
impacts to the local economy. 

RRP partners will continue to organise peaceful co-
existence meetings, to address the concerns of both 
communities and develop solutions to the contentious 
issues affecting them. More visible support from the 
donor community for refugee hosting areas which have 
borne the brunt of the refugee influx will help maintain 
continued access for refugees to international 
protection.

 

Response Strategy and Priorities

Overal Strategy

The complex and evolving protection environment in 
Tanzania requires a multi-faceted response that 
ensures continued protection, access to territory, and 
humanitarian assistance, as well as opportunities for 
durable solutions and self-reliance. Building on the 
initiatives and revising some of the approaches 
launched in 2018, RRP partners will continue to deliver 
on the objectives and priorities below. 

Strategic Objectives 

1. Preserve equal and unhindered access to territorial 
asylum and protection, promote the full enjoyment 
of rights, and maintain the civilian character of 
asylum; 
2. Enable access to essential services according to 
minimum international standards and ensure 
protection systems are strengthened and refugees 
and returnees are able to enjoy their full rights, 
specifically in regard to safety and security, child 
protection, protection from SGBV, and community-
based protection; 
3. Enhance peaceful co-existence and social 
cohesion between host communities and refugees, 
including through protection of the natural 
environment; 
4. Ensure refugees have access to comprehensive 
solutions. 


Priority interventions in Protection, Education, Health 
and Nutrition, Shelter and Core Relief Items (CRIs), 
Livelihoods and Food Security, WASH, Environment 
and Logistics will be implemented to ensure improved 
protection and access to essential services. 

RRP partners will strengthen their efforts in order to 
support and ensure access to asylum and protection for 
persons in need of international protection and to 
advance comprehensive durable solutions. At the same 
time focus will remain on supporting community self-
reliance and promoting peaceful co-existence between 
refugees and host communities. 

The current encampment policy limits refugees’ access 
to markets and income generating opportunities. RRP 
partners will continue to work with the Government of 

Tanzania to review existing policies and explore options 
suited to the current context. 

Focus will remain on strengthening ties with host 
communities as a way of reducing conflict and 
protection related incidents and fostering peaceful co-
existence between both groups. 

Strengthening Livelihoods and Resilience 

Tanzania’s long-term development goals are outlined in 
the Tanzania Development Vision 2025, which aims to 
transform the country into middle-income-country 
status. However, the Kigoma Region is one of the 
poorest in Tanzania and is one of only two regions 
which have experienced increased poverty rates 
between 2001 and 2012. According to the Human 
Development Index 2016, Kigoma Region has one of 
the lowest humanitarian development rankings in 
Tanzania.38 

38 Tanzania Human Development Report: Economic 
Transformation for Human Development (2016) 

 

The population increase in the region has exacerbated 
land pressures and heightened local level tensions and 
conflicts. In both cases, vulnerable groups in the 
refugee and host communities are disproportionally 
affected. While there is a great need for socio-economic 
development in the Kigoma Region, refugees find 
themselves faced with additional hardship, arising out of 
the protection environment.39 

39 World Bank and UNHCR Impact of Refugee Presence on 
Host Populations in Tanzania Assessment (2018) 

However, the large influx of refugees offers both 
challenges and opportunities for socio-economic 
development in host communities. The most significant 
challenge facing the government is ensuring the 
protection of refugees and host communities whilst 
implementing measures that promote sustainable 
livelihoods and socio-economic development. 

It is therefore imperative that the refugee response 
benefits both the refugee and host communities. 
Strengthening livelihoods and resilience requires an 
integrated approach that includes both refugees and 
host communities. Although this approach has hit a few 
obstacles, includingincreased restrictions on 
livelihoods, bolstering livelihoods and resilience 
remains critical for refugees and host communities. 
Refugees who are denied the opportunity to develop 


resilience are unlikely to be resilient at the onset of 
repatriation. While voluntary repatriation is considered a 
durable solution, returnees who remain vulnerable in 
the country of origin are often more likely to flee their 
country again and re-return to Tanzania. 

The United Nations Kigoma Joint Programme is a step 
in the right direction in that not is it cross-cutting, it also 
links the UN’s current humanitarian response to 
refugees and migrants with an increased focus on 
supporting host communities. Moving beyond quick-
impact projects (QUIPs) to more long-term projects with 
broad-based benefits can help build resilience and shift 
the perception of refugees as a burden. Improving host 
community resilience can also potentially strengthen the 
refugee protection space by equipping them with tools 
to accommodate more refugees should a new influx 
occur. Developing partnerships with non-traditional 
actors from the private sector such as mobile network 
companies and financial institutions, would also open 
up opportunities to both communities. 

The majority of the population in Tanzania’s rural and 
urban areas depends largely on wood-based fuel for 
cooking and lighting due to the lack of affordable and 
suitable alternatives or the comparatively high costs of 
other potential alternatives. The country’s energy profile 
for the past decade indicates that 90% of the total 
energy supply was derived from biomass and 
consumed mainly in the form of wood energy. In Kigoma 
Region, that usage is 99%, so far above the already 
high average. Livelihood activities related to energy 
provision will continue to be pursued. However, with the 
restriction of livelihood activities, more emphasis will be 
placed on skills training, business and financial 
management within the camps.

Background and Achievements

Overview 

There are 39,948 refugees and asylum seekers from 
the DRC who are being hosted in Zambia, as at 
September 2018. The total refugee population in the 
country stands at 72,184 persons of concern and 
includes also other populations of persons of concern 
such as non-DRC asylum seekers and refugees from 
Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia, and others, as well as 
22,743 former Rwandan and Angolan refugees.The 
vast majority of refugees in Zambia live in three 
settlements, namely Mayukwayukwa (Kaoma District, 
Western Province), Meheba (Kalumbila District, North-
western Province) and Mantapala (Nchelenge District, 
Luapula Province), and the rest have self-settled in one 
of the provinces across the country, as well as in urban 
areas including Lusaka and Ndola. Mantapala 
settlement was established in early 2018 to host 
Congolese new arrivals from Haut Katanga and 
Tanganyika provinces of the DRC entering through 
Luapula Province. 

As of August 2017, Zambia has been receiving an 
increasing number of refugees fleeing conflict in the 
DRC who are mostly arriving through informal and 
formal border crossings in Luapula Province. Refugees 
entering through the North, North-Western and 
Copperbelt provinces, all of which border with the DRC, 
have also continued to seek asylum and protection. The 
current wave of refugees has arisen mainly due to 
delays in the electoral process and increased 
polarization between the opposition and the current 
administration in the DRC. Since January 2017, Zambia 
has received 22,226 Congolese refugees, of which 
15,642 have entered through Luapula Province and 
some 11,449 have settled in Mantapala or the 
surrounding villages. About 3,292 have been registered 
in Lusaka, while Meheba and Mayukwayukwa have also 
received 2,646 and 646 refugees respectively, imposing 
various challenges on Zambia to adequately receive 
such numbers considering its current reception 
capacities. 

Ever since attaining independence Zambia has 
maintained an open border policy and has hosted 
refugees from countries in the region and beyond, 
including the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as 
Angola, Mozambique, Rwanda, Burundi, South Africa, 
Zimbabwe and Somalia. However, the unpredictable 
and volatile situation in Zambia's neighbouring 
countries has and will continue to require an up-scaling 
of preparedness to ensure access to asylum for new 
arrivals, dignified reception conditions and centres, 
timely biometric registration and status determination, 
and basic assistance and protection interventions, 
especially for the most vulnerable. While the vast 
majority of new arrivals will originate from various 
provinces in the DRC, refugees from other refugee 
producing countries such as Burundi and Somalia will 
also continue to seek safety in Zambia. 

In an effort to improve the protection environment and 
find concrete solutions for new arrivals and protracted 
refugee caseloads, the Government of the Republic of 
Zambia made a number of landmark commitments at 
the UN Leaders’ Summit on Refugees towards 
improving the lives and rights of refugees living in 
Zambia. Specifically, the Head of State, President 
Edgar Lungu pledged to: 

1. Locally integrate eligible Angolans and Rwandans 
and extend the local integration programme to 
protracted Congolese refugees; 
2. Consider relaxing the encampment policy, allowing 
for more freedom of movement for refugees by 
easing the process for acquiring urban residency 
and permission to leave the refugee settlements; 
3. Promote self-reliance and enhance favourable 
measures for refugees to access work and engage 
in income generating activities of their choice; 
4. Focus on ensuring access to education for refugee 
children through the provision of education 
infrastructure in the refugee settlements; 
5. Simplify its admission procedures for a fair Refugee 
Status Determination (RSD) process; 
6. Ensure that refugees have access to civil 
registration and other legal documents. 


Translating these pledges into action, rooted in the 
process of local integration of former refugees from 
Angola and Rwanda (2014-2016) and in line with the 
Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework being 
rolled-out in Zambia, an integrated settlement approach 
is being applied for new arrivals from the DRC, enabling 
the inclusion of refugees into service delivery systems 
and access to livelihoods, while strengthening support 
to host communities. As such, a whole-of-government 
approach is being applied to the ongoing refugee 
response through linkages with national and provincial 
development priorities and plans. In this line, though 
with limited human and financial resources, line 
ministries, UN agencies, NGOs and the private sector 
have been engaged to respond to the recent influx. 

Based on the Congolese refugee emergency 
experienced during 2017 and 2018, Government and 
partners in Zambia are compelled to put in place 
adequate staffing and measures to respond to the 
growing humanitarian and development needs of 
refugees and the communities that host them. In 2019, 
partners will continue engaging the Government to 
ensure inclusion of the developmental needs of refugee 
hosting areas in ward and local development processes 
and plans. Similarly, in view of a possible large new 
influx of Congolese refugees, partners have and will 
continue to put any measures possible in place to be 
prepared for such event, especially during the DRC 
post-election period in the first months of 2019. Space 
currently available in the three settlement should be 
sufficient to accommodate new arrivals, however as 
Meheba and Mayukwayukwa settlements have been in 


existence for more than four decades, available 
infrastructures will no longer be adequate to receive 
refugees in dignity. The Government and partners will 
be required to invest in rehabilitation and new 
infrastructures. 

In order to complement Government and other partners’ 
ongoing efforts, the Zambia RRP 2019-2020 will build 
on existing programmes such as the Sustainable 
Resettlement Programme of Former Refugees, the 
legislative changes in line with the 2017 Refugees Act 
and the pledges made at the New York Summit in 2016 
by the Head of State. CERF funding secured in 2018 by 
six UN Agencies for the establishment of the new 
integrated Mantapala settlement facilitated the active 
involvement of UN partners to support the Government 
in the emergency response which has also benefitted to 
a great extent host communities. Despite continuous 
resource mobilization efforts, development partners 
remain largely unfunded and especially those who were 
supported by CERF funding up to August 2018, have 
handed over to relevant line ministries as no other 
funding sources have been found to support their 
efforts. However, UNHCR will continue to strengthen 
relations with Permanent Secretaries, relevant Line 
Ministries' Directors, and maintain constructive dialogue 
with bilateral/multilateral development partners active in 
the country with the expectation that UN development 
partners and Government will receive the adequate 
support to provide services to all refugees across the 
country, especially for new arrivals including women, 
boys and girls who are often the most vulnerable.

The inter-agency response in Zambia will target all new 
arrival and protracted Congolese refugee populations in 
urban areas and settlements. With an estimated 
Congolese refugee population of 72,000 by end of 2019 
and 58,000 by end of 2020, other persons of concern 
including refugees from other nationalities and former 
refugees will also be assisted and benefit from partners’ 
development interventions. 

Needs and Vulnerabilities40

40 Need analysis also include information for the total of the refugee population in the country, which stands at 72,184 persons of concern – including 
45,310 refugees of whom the 83 per cent are from the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as some 22,743 former Rwandan and Angolan 
refugees and 4,131 asylums seekers of different nationalities. The vast majority of refugees in Zambia live in three settlements, namely 
Mayukwayukwa (Kaoma District, Western Province), Meheba (Kalumbila District, North-western Province) and Mantapala (Nchelenge District, 
Luapula Province), and the rest have self-settled in one of the provinces across the country, or registered in urban areas including Lusaka and 
Ndola. 

The Government of Zambia has continued to maintain 
its open-door policy and has allowed humanitarian 
access and protection to asylum seekers into its 
territory. The increasing number of arrivals and potential 
for a larger influx during the pre- and post-election 
period in the DRC continues to impose a challenge on 
the Government’s reception capacity. Reception 
facilities along the various border entry points, as well 
as those in the refugee settlements and in urban areas 
including Lusaka, barely meet the minimum reception 
conditions and standards that address basic and 
psychosocial needs for new arrivals in a dignified 
manner. Overcrowding and provision of basic services 

such as water supply and sanitation are also in need of 
urgent maintenance and upgrading. 

Populations with specific needs including 
unaccompanied children, SGBV survivors, persons 
living with disabilities, the elderly, etc., require a more 
complex, comprehensive national response. As arrivals 
of DRC nationals continue to increase, more cases of 
large, single-headed households with presence of 
children, elderly and survivors of SGBV are settling in 
the country requiring a more comprehensive social 
protection response. Similarly, the humanitarian needs 
of the new arrivals are often equally applicable to the 
needs of protracted populations, especially in Meheba 


and Mayukwayukwa, where a large number of 
vulnerable protracted cases are far from reaching self-
reliance levels due to a prolonged dependency on 
assistance and limited access to income generating 
opportunities. Given the limited resources and 
institutional capacity to comprehensively address the 
needs of vulnerable population groups, coupled with the 
lack of safety social nets, which refugees may rely upon, 
serious protection challenges persists for these groups. 

Zambia’s encampment policy remains one of the major 
protection challenges. Restrictions on freedom of 
movement is the primary concern and source of 
discontentment among the refugee population as it 
limits their access to essential goods, sources of 
income, education options and access to social 
services, including health and higher education. In this 
line, access to secondary health services that are not 
available in the settlements poses a threat for refugees’ 
and host communities’ well-being. Similarly, while 
primary education and secondary may be available in 
the settlements, the available infrastructure and staffing 
does not meet the student/ratio government standards. 

As a result of the limitation imposed on freedom of 
movement, many refugees reside in urban areas 
without authorization, exposing them to a number of 
risks, including detention. Nonetheless, over 10,049 
refugees are officially registered and have adequate 
documentation to live in urban areas. UNHCR and 
partners have and will continue advocating with COR for 
the Government to implement the Presidential 
commitment made at the Leaders’ Summit in 2016 to 
relax the implementation of the encampment policy and 
allow refugees to engage in meaningful livelihood 
activities outside the settlements, in line with the spirit of 
the Global Compact on Refugees. 

Zambia has supported the local integration of long-
staying refugees, however, this needs to be promoted 
further as in the case of Angolan and Rwandan refugees 
who opted to stay in the country following the cessation 
of their status and whose integration has not yet been 
concluded despite the Local Integration Programme 
having come to an end in 2016. UN development 
partners are currently supporting the Government to 
ease the local integration process but these efforts 
however also depend on the improvement of 
infrastructure and provision of services in the 
resettlement areas where former refugees have been 
given free land by the Government. As of now, limited 
investment in these areas has hindered former refugees 
to occupy their plots and as such demotivated them to 
move out of the refugee settlements. Lastly, the fear of 
exacerbating jealousy and xenophobia within the host 
population in the settlements and urban areas, following 
a number of xenophobic attacks in 2016 on refugee-
owned businesses in Lusaka, challenges efforts made 
to ensure peaceful coexistence between refugee and 
host populations. 

In an effort to create a favourable protection 
environment which is conducive for refugees and host 
communities to thrive, partners will continue to ensure 
that infrastructure and services in the existing 
settlements are expanded and the settlements 
progressively transform into villages encompassing 
both refugees and host communities, as is happening in 
Mantapala. The road network in all three settlements 
require contrcution, repairs or upgrading, so as to 
facilitate access and mobility to and from, as well as 
service delivery to the settlements. Similarily, access to 
energy and connectivity will be key to the development 
of the settlements and to creating livelihood 
opportunities in those areas. Close working relations 
with and involvement of traditional leadership in refugee 
hosting areas will be key to achieve this goal. 

Host communities 

Zambia has over the past decades hosted a refugee 
population of up to 200,000, including multiple large 
emergency influxes stemming from conflicts in 
neighbouring countries. Throughout, host communities 
and local authorities have continued to receive refugees 
generously, despite the underlying poverty and 
vulnerability of the communities- which are often remote 
and under-developed, especially in Luapula Province, 
one of Zambia’s poorest.The limited resources and 
facilities in the host community areas often lead to their 
limited resilience to shocks, including the offset of 
sudden influx of refugees. Lack of sufficient WASH, 
Health, Land, Food and Education facilities are the most 
prominent and affected services when posed with an 
influx to the host community. 

Zambia, being a Comprehensive Refugee Response 
Framework (CRRF) pilot country, is embarking in 
ensuring the setting up of an integrated development 
plan in all refugee hosting provinces and districts by 
having refugees fall part of the national service delivery 
structures. This will enable strengthening the capacity 
and sustainable development of national systems by 
directing support to mainstreaming refugees in existing 
or planned structures for host communities instead of 
setting-up parallel systems- an effort that will benefit all.

 

 

 

 


Response Strategy and Priorities

 

Overal Strategy 

 

In order to address the protection immediate and 
ongoing needs, as well as to identify the most 
appropriate solutions for refugees across the country, a 
number of prioritized objectives will be pursued to 
ensure that refugees and their host communities are 
empowered and supported adequately. 

The Strategic Priorities are as follows: 

1. Refugees, asylum seekers and others of concern 
have effective access to international protection 
processes provided by the Government of Zambia. 
2. The immediate humanitarian needs of refugees 
continue to be responded to, while progressively 
transitioning towards Government-led responses 
(education, health, water, social services). 
3. Refugee settlements are transformed into 
integrated settlements and included into national 
development programmes, as well as Government 
led services benefitting both refugees and host 
communities. 
4. Refugees and host communities benefit from 
livelihoods opportunities which strengthen self-
reliance and promote socio-economic inclusion. 
5. Opportunities for durable solutions such as local 
integration, voluntary repatriation/return and 
resettlement will be explored for individuals and 
groups. 


These objectives will be complemented by informed 
advocacy efforts for the Government to accede and 
domesticate the Statelessness Conventions and for the 
lifting of certain reservations to the 1951 Refugee 
Convention, especially on freedom of movement and 
the right to work. According to participatory 
assessments and socio-economic evaluations, these 
partial reservations continue to hamper refugees’ ability 
to access stable income generating activities and 
become self-reliant. UNHCR will actively engage with 
the Office of the Commissioner for Refugees to develop 
the new refugee policy that will guide the 
implementation of the 2017 Refugees Act. The Act 
provides the legislative prerequisites for applying a 
comprehensive refugee response, including access to 
territory, provision of protection and identification of 
solutions. It also represents a significant shift from the 
1970 Refugee Control Act, enabling the Government to 
implement a settlement approach, granting refugees a 
variety of rights and access to services, and allowing to 
facilitate permanent residency and naturalization as an 
alternative legal status. 

Building on the recently launched 7th National 
Development Plan (7NDP), the UN-GRZ Sustainable 
Development Partnership Framework and the National 
Decentralization Policy, aspects of inclusion and self-
reliance of marginalized populations, including 
refugees, are being pursued by working with district and 
provincial authorities, ensuring refugee hosting areas 
are included in development plans at all levels. In line 
with the CRRF, an inter-ministerial committee appointed 
by the President of the Republic to lead and coordinate 
the Government’s response towards the Congolese 
refugee emergency was put in place in early 2018, 
establishing a coordination structure at national level. At 
technical level, a national steering committee 
comprising various line ministries has also been put in 
place to ensure coherence between local, provincial 
and central level decision making processes are in line 
with the needs of refugee hosting districts. 

The CRRF applicationin Zambia has a particular focus 
on the areas of i) Admission and Rights, ii) Inclusion of 
refugees into national service delivery programmes, iii) 
Self-reliance and access to livelihoods, and iv) Durable 
Solutions including local integration and third country 
solutions. In an attempt to promote peaceful co-
existence and ensure that development interventions 
are equally enjoyed by the host communities, 20% of 
the target population in livelihoods projects and other 
support programmes will be included from the local 
communities in all three refugee settlements and 
Lusaka. With an estimated total refugee population of 
82,500 by end 2019, including 72,000 refugees from the 
DRC, of which 62,500 are expected to reside in the 
refugee settlements, some 14,000 host community 
members are envisaged to be included in partners’ 
interventions directly, in an effort to ensure that 
livelihoods and self-reliance of both population groups 
are addressed and supported. As such, partners in this 
CRRP expect that refugee hosting areas in Zambia will 
increasingly contribute to the country’s social and 
economic development and lead the way towards 
achieving its vision of becoming a prosperous middle 
income country by 2030. 

Following UNHCR’s global call to institutionalize, 
expand and systemize the use of multi-purpose cash 
based interventions (CBI) in order to address diverse 
needs, reduce protection risks and contribute to 
solutions through rights-based and community-based 
approaches, partners are in the process of identifying 
areas of support that can be included under CBI. Cash 
support could address food, core relief items, education 
and health needs, among others. With an ongoing CBI 
mobile money pilot in Meheba, UNHCR, WFP and 
partners are seeking to expand CBIs to all settlements 
and Lusaka and are in the process of carrying out 
feasibility studies with the aim of assessing availability 
and cost of various potential items for inclusion under 
CBIs. By combining support with new payment 
technologies, partners expect that financial inclusion will 
also be improved and may also link refugees and host 
communities to national social protection and safety 
nets programmes. 


In Zambia, all services provided in the three settlements 
including schools, health clinics, water points, markets 
and community centres are of equal access to refugees 
and host communities. This approach has been notably 
accepted among host populations in Mantapala, who 
prior to the arrival of refugees to the area had to walk 
several kilometres to access most of these amenities. 
To date, and in an effort to ensure the sustainability of 
programmes and in line with the whole of government 
approach which the CRRF calls for, various line 
ministries are in the process of assigning their own staff 
to deliver such services in Mantapala, as they await for 
staff houses to be completed. In Meheba and 
Mayukwayukwa, where NGOs are shyly present at the 
moment, all services available to refugees and host 
communities are provided by relevant government 
departments. As per the 2017 Refugees Act, the Office 
of the Commissioner for Refugees has not only 
assumed its mandated role to fulfil its responsibilities for 
the recognition of refugees, but also to ensure that 
adequate facilities and services for the reception and 
care for refugees in the country are in place. As such, 
all line ministries working in the refugee settlements are 
now working under one umbrella whereby the Office of 
the Commissioner for Refugees oversees and 
coordinates service delivery in community-based 
protection, health, education, water, sanitation and 
hygiene, among others. 

Strengthening Livelihoods and Resilience 

In line with the New York Declaration for Refugees and 
Migrants and the Global Compact on Refugees, the 
Government and partners have and will continue to 
enhance refugees’ resilience and self-reliance in order 
to achieve the objectives as outlined in the country’s 
comprehensive refugee response. Thus, improving 
livelihoods through economic inclusion and building 
resilience is a key component of achieving protection 
and solutions for refugees in the country. Inter-agency 
assessments and socio-economic surveys and studies 
highlight the potential for refugee and host community 
integrated economies, provided substantial investment 
in agriculture, enterprise development, fishery and 
environment protection is availed. 

The key main livelihood activities for refugees in Zambia 
are farming (subsistence and medium scale), general 
trading of goods, and to some degree fishing. Although 
these three main activities represent a large amount of 
refugees’ source of income, findings indicate that 
refugees possess a diverse range of skills that could 
provide opportunity for greater and diversified 
development and targeted interventions. Skills sets 
relate but are not limited to different sectors including 
health, agriculture, service industry, construction, 
teaching, mechanics, transport, music and enterprise 
development. In this line, refugees have expressed the 
desire for training in entrepreneurship, improved 
agricultural technologies, technical skills training, 
provision of livelihoods physical assets (e.g. agricultural 
tools), business start-up capital, among other 
assistance. 

As such, and in an effort to support income generation 
and resilience of refugees and host communities, 
livelihoods programmes in all refugee settlements 
including Lusaka will be prioritized. In Meheba and 
Mayukwayukwa, refugees and host communities in the 
past have benefitted from various livelihoods projects 
and interventions by INGOs, government and other aid 
agencies. Most notably under the local integration 
programme, former Angolan and Rwandan refugees 
received livelihoods support from RRRP partners and 
the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Livestock and 
Fisheries. 

Former refugees continue to receive support from UN 
development partners in both agriculture and non-
agriculture based livelihood skills. Under the 
programme of Promoting Human Security through 
Sustainable Resettlement in Zambia, which is being 
implemented in Meheba and Mayukwayukwa by RRRP 
partners, the refugees’ capacity is being built to actively 
participate at all levels of the agriculture and marketing 
value chains. Government departments have been 
engaged to provide services in refugee areas, which 
ordinarily are non-traditional areas of operations. In 
training refugees special emphasis has been made on 
entrepreneurship in order to enable them to take 
advantage of economic and business opportunities in 
local value chains. Similarly, a number of refugees and 
host communities in Meheba and Mayukwayukwa are 
benefitting from the Graduation Model, a sequenced, 
multi-sector intervention that supports vulnerable 
households to achieve sustained income. 

RRRP partners are piloting the same approach in 
Lusaka with urban refugees and as for Mantapala, 
livelihoods programming commenced in December 
2017, at the peak of the emergency and have since 
been supported. The interventions include backyard 
gardening and livestock rearing, business start-up, bee-
keeping, dietary diversification and market site 
development. Discussions are ongoing to extend and 
increase livelihoods support for quick impact projects 
(e.g. group entrepreneurship, bricklaying machines for 
bricklayers), rain-fed farming, vocational and technical 
skills training and market structures construction. As a 
temporary measure, an open air market has already 
been established and more than 200 traders and 
entrepreneurs have been given a market plot. 
Response partners have also began a project which is 
aimed at improving post-harvest handling and 
promoting market linkages through aggregated 
modalities for local farmers. This project is expected to 
include refugee farmers in 2019. 

Sustained livelihoods are largely attained through multi-
year livelihoods support and as such there is need to 
ensure that livelihoods programmes in the refugee 
hosting areas are at least annually funded or ideally, 
multi-year based. In addition to extend the current 
interventions in all refugee hosting areas and as per 
lessons learned from previous initiatives, there are a 
number of areas which partners in the RRP will seek to 
address as well, namely: 


1. Facilitating social behaviour change to enable self-
reliance, especially for protracted refugee 
caseloads and former refugees who have over the 
past heavily relied on aid and in-kind assistance; 
2. Youth tailored initiatives to enhance their human 
development and contribute to their physical and 
emotional well-being. Also, in an effort to avoid 
negative coping mechanisms and reduce the 
increasing number of pregnancies among teenage 
girls, youth-tailored livelihoods strategies that will 
shape their aspirations with practical livelihoods 
options, essential skills and knowledge will be 
pursued; 
3. Multi-Purpose Cash Based Initiatives which have 
the potential to provide a more dignified form of 
assistance, giving refugees the ability to prioritise 
and choose what they need and boost the local 
economy. 


Given the existing challenges and legal framework, 
partners will continue advocating for an environment 
that will enable the economic inclusion and livelihoods 
of refugees and enhance their access to sustainable 
income generating activities. At the heart of the CRRF 
is a whole of society approach which calls for the 
inclusion of refugees in national and sub-national 
development plans and processes for long term 
planning for solutions and greater investment. The 
interventions under the CRRP will take a coordinated 
and comprehensive approach to empower local 
governments to undertake inclusive and participatory 
planning and governance processes that enable 
refugees and host communities to benefit equally from 
services. 

As such, partners will advocate for refugee hosting 
districts to develop Local Area and District Integrated 
Development Plans that include refugees so that the 
areas can benefit from adequate socio-economic 
infrastructure and services. For this to happen, it will be 
necessary to strengthen the capacity and institutional 
structures of the Councils (Ministry of Local 
Government) for more inclusive and participatory 
planning, and to foster stronger collaboration and 
linkages between line ministries by working with the 
District Development Coordination Committees and 
traditional leadership. In addition, efficient community 
structures are needed for administrating the settlements 
and sustainably managing communal land and 
resources, with the equitable participation of refugees 
and host communities. 

 

 

 

Planned Response for 2019 and 2020 

 

 

As outlined in Zambia’s comprehensive refugee response and its integrated focus on emergency, self-reliance and 
solutions, the inter-agency efforts will support Government in dealing with protracted refugees and new arrivals, mainly 
from the DRC in 2019 and 2020. 

It is intented to achieve the following planned response activities and interventions by 2020:
