FOR MANY YEARS, OUR COUNTRY’S SECURITY AND STABILITY AND OUR CITIZENS’ 
GENEROUS COMPASSION HAVE LED DESPERATE REFUGEES TO OUR DOORS. IN THE PAST 
FIVE YEARS THE SYRIAN CRISIS HAS SENT JORDAN’S BURDEN SKYROCKETING. SOME 2.5 
MILLION SYRIANS HAVE CROSSED INTO JORDAN SINCE 2011. ... ACROSS MY COUNTRY, 
JORDANIANS ARE SUFFERING. NO ONE IS JUSTIFIED IN QUESTIONING OUR COMMITMENT 
AND SACRIFICES. THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACT HAS SHOCKED EVERY SECTOR, EVERY 
COMMUNITY; AND IT HAS SET BACK THE STRIDES OF OUR ECONOMY AND HAS CREATED 
TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS IN OUR DEVELOPMENT, JOB GROWTH AND DEBT REDUCTION.

AS A COLLECTIVE EFFORT, WE MUST NOW ADEQUATELY RESPOND TO THE TRUE EXPECTED 
NEED, THE TRUE BROAD IMPACT, AND THE TRUE DURATION OF THE CRISIS. TO THIS END, 
JORDAN HAS PUT FORWARD AN EFFECTIVE, SUSTAINABLE, DEVELOPMENT-DRIVEN PLAN 
TO SUPPORT HOSTS AND REFUGEES ALIKE. OUR APPROACH WILL BUILD ON INTERNATIONAL

FOREWORD

NEW PARADIGMS IN RESPONSIBILITY SHARING

In this era of mass migration, the world is facing a crisis of unequaled 
proportions, one that is testing the response capacities of numerous 
nations and demanding new paradigms in responsibility and fair 
burden sharing. 

Since its onset in 2011, the Syria crisis has become the defining human 
rights issue of our time, not only due to the sheer humanitarian 
costs involved but also due to the fragmented response of the 
international community. Six years into the crisis, Jordan continues 
to meet its moral obligations, bearing more than its fair share of the 
response and exhausting its absorptive capacities to meet the short 
and long-term needs of those seeking refuge within its borders. 
Today, Jordan hosts around 1.3 million Syrians, constituting nearly 
20% of the Jordanian population and placing considerable strain on 
our socioeconomic foundations. The influx of refugees has become 
the foremost challenge facing the kingdom, undermining decades 
of hard-earned developmental gains and exhausting what little 
resources are available to its people. 

Mitigating this challenge can only work under the premise that Jordan is doing is a global public good 
on behalf of the international community. The Government of Jordan has set a remarkable example in its 
response to this complex and protracted crisis, taking a bold and innovative initiative to bring together 
humanitarian and development programming under a common, nationally-led and resilience-based 
framework. The first result of this approach was the 2015 Jordan Response Plan (JRP), which successfully 
laid the groundwork for a series of achievements that allowed the Kingdom to withstand the devastating 
impact of the crisis. 

This holistic approach was further developed in the Jordan Response Plan 2016-2018, which adopted a 
three-year rolling framework that is more equipped to deal with the protracted nature of the crisis. The 
plan was developed in full partnership with donors, UN agencies and international organizations, outlining 
a coherent and sequenced response to the multifaceted impact of the crisis and building on the findings 
of a comprehensive vulnerability assessment prepared in close collaboration with the international 
community. Today, we are presenting the international community with the second iteration of this rolling 
plan — The JRP 2017-2019 — which continues to outline the unmet needs of refugees within Jordan’s 
borders and those of the communities hosting them as well as costs being incurred by government.

Despite Jordan’s steadfast efforts, funding shortfalls continue to pose the largest obstacle in the face of 
this collective response. Although 2016 marked a significant increase in secured funding for the JRP, which 
reached 54% compared to an average of 33% for prior years, close to half of the needs in 2016 remained 
unfunded. This was fifth consecutive year in which funding shortfalls compromised the government’s 
response to the Syria crisis, which constitutes a glaring sign for the international community to further 
increase its grant funding to JRP. Safeguarding the fair sharing of responsibility continues to prove a 
staggering challenge for the global community, despite the fact that only 10 percent of the world’s official 
developmental assistance is sufficient to meet the response requirements of the entire region. 



vi

In its ongoing efforts to further improve its holistic response to the impact of the Syria Crisis, Jordan took 
yet another pioneering initiative by signing the Jordan Compact during the 2016 ‘Supporting Syria and 
the Region’ conference in London. Through the Jordan Compact, the government sought to transform 
the refugee crisis into a development opportunity that attracts new investments and opens up the EU 
market with simplified rules of origin, thus creating jobs for both Jordanians and Syrian refugees in a 
complimentary, non-competitive manner to Jordanian job creation. Jordan is already providing public 
education services to 90% of registered Syrian boys and girls out of Jordan’s belief to ensure not lost Syrian 
generation and has also been working hard to mobilize sufficient resources to provide educational catch 
up programmes to a remaining 25,000 Syrian children by the 2016/2017 school year. 

Recognizing the need to continue strengthening management of the plan, the JRP 2017-2019 also 
addresses the need to further capacitate line ministries and task forces to ensure that they have the full 
ability to engage in sector-wide multi-stakeholder planning, with greater alignment to government 
policies and systems. The plan has also been designed under the overall framework set by the Jordan Vision 
2025 and in alignment and coordination with the main national plans and strategies, such as the Executive 
Development Programme, the Governorates Development Programmes and the Jordan Compact and in a 
manner that creates complementarity and avoids duplication.

Moreover, Jordan’s commitment to ensuring accuracy and transparency in its response to the Syria crisis led 
to the creation of JORISS — a comprehensive data management system conceived to help in the uploading, 
approval, tracking and reporting on the various projects within the Jordan Response Plan. JORISS provides 
an intuitive online interface that simplifies the processes of uploading, approving, tracking and reporting 
on projects, in addition to providing a graphical representation of vulnerabilities, achievements and 
ongoing activities at governorate, district and local levels. 

As the Jordan Response Plan is predicated on reinforcing solidarity and pursuing a credible transition 
from emergency to longer term sustainability and resilience, the government has taken bold steps over 
the last 12 months to improve aid coordination, increase transparency, and strengthen accountability as 
a means of increasing overall aid effectiveness. It is critical to note that Jordan has reached its maximum 
absorptive capacity with no fiscal space remaining. Between the Kingdom’s evanescing resources, existing 
socioeconomic and geopolitical challenges, and the IMF’s new Extended Fund Facility, funding shortfalls will 
severely compromise the government’s ability to continue providing services to Syrians while safeguarding 
the country’s hard-earned developmental gains. 

 Given this state of urgency, I call upon all donors to continue investing in the Jordanian model to ensure the 
long-term success of this paradigm shift. Support should take the form of additional grants to sufficiently 
fund the JRP, with a focus on rebuilding the needs of host communities nationwide, in addition to increased 
budget support grants given the lack of any remaining fiscal space. The international community should 
also work toward securing additional concessionary financing for middle income countries affected by 
neighboring conflicts and building on the Concessional Financing Facility that Jordan pioneered in 
partnership with the World Bank, the Islamic Development Bank and donor countries. Last but not least, 
the international community should consider debt reduction and swap mechanisms as a means for host 
governments to increase fiscal space.

THE GOVERNMENT OF JORDAN HAS SET A REMARKABLE EXAMPLE IN ITS 
RESPONSE TO THIS COMPLEX AND PROTRACTED CRISIS, TAKING A BOLD 
AND INNOVATIVE INITIATIVE TO BRING TOGETHER HUMANITARIAN AND 
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMING UNDER A COMMON, NATIONALLY-LED AND 
RESILIENCE-BASED FRAMEWORK. 



GIVEN THIS STATE OF URGENCY, I CALL UPON ALL DONORS TO 
CONTINUE INVESTING IN THE JORDANIAN MODEL TO ENSURE THE 
LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF THIS PARADIGM SHIFT. 

It is also critical for donors to note that additional assistance must take into consideration the precipitating 
factors that determine the carrying capacity and exacerbate the burden shouldered by host countries, 
such as the availability of natural and physical resources, the accumulative number of refugees hosted due 
to prior conflicts, the proportion of refugees to the local population, the distribution of refugees in and 
out of camps, the income level of the country, and the limit to which its absorptive capacity is stretched. 
Any assistance provided should not only cover needs moving forward but also take into consideration 
accumulated funding gaps of prior years. 

We are at a moment of critical opportunity and must collectively deliver on the promise of the Jordan 
Compact and the Jordan Response Plan 2017-19. I call upon our partners, UN agencies, the donor 
community and NGOs to support Jordan as it continues to forge a new model of response capable of 
meeting immediate needs while also safeguarding human development and fostering resilience to future 
shocks.

In closing, I would like to offer my sincere gratitude to our partners for their tireless efforts and invaluable 
support over the past year, particularly line ministries, UN agencies, the donor community and NGOs. Our 
gratitude also goes to the international community for its financial support, partnership, and collaboration. 
Lastly, I extend my gratitude to the United Nations, MOPIC’s Humanitarian Relief Coordination Unit, and 
the JRPSC Secretariat for their collective efforts in the development of a cohesive, comprehensive response 
plan. 

Sincerely,

Imad Najib Fakhoury

Minister of Planning & International Cooperation

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

With the Syria crisis entering its seventh year in 2017, Jordan is hosting some 1.266 million Syrians,1 of 
which 655,833 are registered as refugees.2 Providing for their needs, without jeopardizing Jordanian 
people, institutions and systems’ development gains and opportunities, has impacted heavily on Jordan’s 
finances, increasing government expenditures on subsidies, public services and security, while further 
compounding the negative economic consequences of regional instability.

Since 2013, the Government of Jordan has taken a proactive role in seeking to respond to the impact of 
the Syria crisis within a resilience framework, by preparing the National Resilience Plan (NRP) 2014, which 
focused mainly on host communities. As of September 2014, the Jordan Response Platform for the Syria Crisis 
(JRPSC) was established to coordinate, guide and provide oversight to the preparation, implementation 
and monitoring of the JRP 2015 and the JRP 2016, which represented a paradigm shift by bridging the 
divide between short-term refugee and longer-term developmental response within a resilience-based 
comprehensive framework. According to some researchers, the JRP is the most sophisticated response to 
the Syrian refugee crisis among all the major neighboring host countries.3 

The JRP 2017–19 is a three-year plan that seeks to address the needs and vulnerabilities of Syrian refugees 
and Jordanian people, communities and institutions affected by the crisis. It incorporates refugee and 
resilience responses into one comprehensive vulnerability assessment and one single plan for each sector, 
thereby placing the resilience of the people in need and of the national systems at the core of the response. 
The JRP2017-19 fully integrates the most recent policy decisions taken by the Government of Jordan on 
livelihood and education issues, thereby becoming the only comprehensive Plan for the Syria crisis in 
Jordan.

ACCORDING TO SOME RESEARCHERS, THE JRP IS THE MOST SOPHISTICATED 
RESPONSE TO THE SYRIAN REFUGEE CRISIS AMONG ALL THE MAJOR 
NEIGHBORING HOST COUNTRIES.

In order to maximise the possibilities of securing reliable and predictable funds to assist in the 
delivery of both short-term humanitarian and longer-term resilience-based interventions, the plan 
adopts a multi-year approach spanning 36 months. Finally, the JRP2017–19 is not conceived in an 
institutional vacuum but it is a component of a wider national planning process framed under the 
‘Jordan 2025’ development blueprint that reflects the country’s long term national vision.

BUDGET AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

The JRP 2017-19 total budget is USD 7,642,278,470, including USD 2,961,764,748 for budget support, 
USD 2,181,577,741 for refugee-related interventions and USD 2,498,935,981 for resilience strengthening, 
including that of communities where both Jordanians and Syrians live. The JRP budget per year is the 
following:

Budget requirements for refugee and resilience programmatic response have been disaggregated into 
projects listed though detailed project summary sheets (PSS), which are annexed to the Plan. Each PSS 
includes relevant information, such as project objective, outputs, location and beneficiaries. Also PSSs 
within each sector have been prioritized based on commonly agreed criteria. 

The implementation of the Plan will be guided by the JRPSC, under the leadership of the Government of 
Jordan. 

The JRPSC Secretariat will work with MOPIC Humanitarian Relief Coordination Unit (HRCU) to facilitate the 
swift implementation and accurate monitoring of JRP projects. JORISS will be the information management 
system to ensure that all money for the JRP is tracked and accounted for, through any of the different 
channels approved by the government for the financing of the plan: budget support, pooled funds or 
project aid for public entities, UN agencies, NGOs or other implementing partners. 

The plan consists of five chapters. (I) Context and Methodology; (II) Comprehensive Vulnerability 
Assessment; (III) Sector Response Plans; (IV) Impact of the Syria Crisis and Specific Budget Support Needs; 
and (V) Management Arrangements. 

Chapter one consists of an overview of the scope and objective of the plan and the process that has led to 
its elaboration. Chapter 2 identifies the vulnerabilities, needs and gaps in assistance to refugees and host 
communities, and seeks to measure the impact of the crisis on key public service sectors and their capacity 
to cope with the additional demand arising from the influx of refugees. Chapter 3 presents the 12 sector 
response plans, with an update on 2016 contributions and achievements, an overview of outstanding 
needs, and the strategies that have been developed by sector task forces to meet them, including proposed 
projects. Chapter four outlines the direct budget support needs of the government to deal with the impact 
of the crisis with a breakdown according to expenditures under the main budget lines: subsidies, income 
loss and security. Chapter 5 outlines the management arrangements including proposed procedures for 
the appraisal, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of projects.

KEYNOTE SPEECH DURING THE RESILIENCE DEVELOPMENT FORUM

1.1 OVERVIEW OF THE IIMPACT OF THE CCRISIS ON JORDAN

The Syrian conflict is arguably the most tragic humanitarian crisis of our time.4 Since 2011, half of the 
country’s pre-war population — more than 11 million people — have been killed or have fled their homes. 
Families are struggling to survive inside Syria or make a new life in neighbouring countries. Others are 
risking their lives on the way to Europe, hoping to find acceptance and opportunity.

Currently, countries neighbouring Syria - Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey - host almost 4.8 million registered 
Syrian refugees. Jordan alone has provided refuge to some 1.266 million Syrians,5 of which 655,833 are 
registered as refugees.6 Many of them have now entered a cycle of asset depletion, with savings exhausted 
and levels of debt increasing. The most vulnerable refugees are adopting severe coping strategies, such 
as reducing food consumption, withdrawing children from school or taking on informal, exploitative or 
dangerous employment.

The Syria crisis has a multifaceted impact on Jordanian people and institutions, compounding concurrent 
and mutually aggravating security, economic, political and social factors and ranging impacting — with 
different degrees of intensity — the whole country. This is of particular concern in the northern governorates 
where the share of Syrian refugees, and its pressure on local service delivery, natural resources and the 
labour market, is are greatest.

JORDAN ALONE HAS PROVIDED REFUGE TO SOME 1.266 MILLION SYRIANS, OF 
WHICH 655,833 ARE REGISTERED AS REFUGEES. MANY OF THEM HAVE NOW 
ENTERED A CYCLE OF ASSET DEPLETION, WITH SAVINGS EXHAUSTED AND 
LEVELS OF DEBT INCREASING.

TThese increasing challenges and vulnerabilities are playing out against a backdrop of poor macroeconomic 
performance. While Jordan’s GDP was growing at an average annual rate of 15.2 percent during the period 
2006-2010, this growth rate slowed to 6 percent in the years following the Syria crisis (2011-2016). During 
the same period, public debt has risen by a staggering 82.8 percent to exceed USD 34.5 billion in 2016 (92.9 
percent of GDP)7 and foreign direct investment experienced an accelerated decrease, declining by a rate 
of 42.6 percent during the period 2011-2016. Despite the sharp decrease in global oil prices, trade deficit 
continued to increase from USD 9.63 billion in 2010 to USD 12.52 billion in 2015.8

CHAPTER ONE

CONTEXT AND METHODOLOGY



From the onset of the Syria crisis till 2016, the direct cost of hosting Syrian refugees on the Kingdom has 
totalled US$8.6 billion.9 This includes the costs of education, health services and subsidies on electricity, 
water, healthcare services, infrastructure services, municipal services and other goods, in addition to losses 
incurred by the transport sector, illegal labour and security/military costs. Since 2013, the cost of hosting 
Syrian refugees averaged to around 16 percent of the Kingdom’s national budget. The indirect costs of 
Syrian refugee crisis and its spill-over effects to the Jordanian economy averaged US$3.1–3.5 billion per 
year in addition to direct costs that government annually has been shouldering.10 

OF THE TOTAL NON-JORDANIAN POPULATION, 1.266 MILLION ARE SYRIANS, 
CONSTITUTING 46 PER CENT OF NON-JORDANIANS LIVING IN THE KINGDOM 
AND 13.2 PER CENT OF THE OVERALL POPULATION. 

While the international community has been supportive towards Jordan, development and humanitarian 
aid have not kept pace with the increasing needs and requirements. Recognizing that the existing situation 
is unsustainable, Jordan and its international partners have agreed on a paradigm shift that promotes 
economic development and opportunities for all and provide further financial support to Syrian refugees, 
host communities and Jordanian institutions.11 

The JRP2017-19 consolidates all required efforts to respond and mitigate the impact of the Syria crisis on 
the country and the people living in it. It is the only recognized national document within the framework 
of which international grants for the Syria crisis should be provided.

According to the latest national Census, the total population of Jordan is estimated around 9.5 million, 
including 6.6 million Jordanians. Of the total non-Jordanian population, 1.266 million are Syrians, constituting 
46 per cent of non-Jordanians living in the Kingdom and 13.2 per cent of the overall population. On the 
distribution of Syrians living in Jordan, 435,578 are estimated living in Amman, 343,479 in Irbid, 207,903 in 
Mafraq, 175,280 in Zarqa and the rest are distributed across the country’s other governorates.12

Out of the total number of Syrians in Jordan, 656,000 are registered as refugees with the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Of these, around 141,000 refugees live in a camp setting, either 
in Azraq, Emirati Jordanian Camp or Za’atari, while the vast majority — some 515,000 refugees, equivalent 
to 78.4% of all Syrian refugees in Jordan — lives in non-camp settings in rural and urban areas. The highest 
concentrations are in the northern and central Governorates. (see map below for distribution details).13 

Although the monthly arrival rate of Syrians has been fluctuating since mid-year 2016, the total number 
of Syrian refugees registered by UNHCR has grown by more than 21,500 between January and November 
2016.14

THIS SITUATION IS ERODING DEVELOPMENT GAINS MADE BY JORDAN OVER THE 
LAST DECADES AS PLANNED DEVELOPMENT, MAINTENANCE AND EXPANSION 
OF NEW INVESTMENTS, SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE IS SACRIFICED TO PAY 
FOR THE MITIGATION OF THE IMPACT OF THE CRISIS.

Refugees in camps need humanitarian support for shelter, health, water, education and protection services 
to ensure that minimum standards are met. Refugees living in host communities depend more and more 
on government services and international assistance or rely upon negative coping strategies, such as 
limiting food consumption, restricting children’s access to education, engaging in illegal activities, child 
labour or accepting early marriage. Furthermore, Syrian workers in Jordan are willing to accept low wages 
and harsh working conditions, thereby competing with Jordanians in some sectors and further increasing 
the informality of the labour market.15 

In parallel, the needs of vulnerable Jordanian citizens have grown rapidly, with increased competition for 
resources straining the national government’s ability to meet the needs of its citizens. 

Furthermore, the notable deterioration in the quality of services delivered across numerous critical sectors 
- including health, education, water and municipal services – is equally affecting Syrians and Jordanians 
in host communities. Some 200 public schools are running double shift classes to accommodate for 
overcrowding, thereby impacting the quality of education provided to all children. Health centres and 
hospital are unable to keep pace with the growing in the population they are serving. Some 1,441,084 
vaccines have been administered to Syrian refugees, and around 251 thousand Syrian patients used the 
services of Health Ministry hospitals or health centres in 2015.16 

Moreover, 19% of solid waste cannot be landfilled due to lack of landfill capacity and demand for water 
resources has increased by as much as 40 percent in areas heavily populated by Syrians. In some northern 
governorates, per-capita share of water plummeted by 27 percent.17 The presence of a high number of 
Syrians in host communities is also having a significant impact on the labour market, increasing competition 
for available job opportunities, lowering wage levels and exacerbating already poor working conditions 
for low paid jobs. This has forced many vulnerable Jordanians to turn to social protection programmes, 
further stretching the capacity of these schemes. Overall, while some sectors may have benefited from the 
population increase, the overall impact of the crisis on the economy has been detrimental.

This situation is eroding development gains made by Jordan over the last decades as planned development, 
maintenance and expansion of new investments, services and infrastructure is sacrificed to pay for the 
mitigation of the impact of the crisis.

1.2 THE JORDAN RESPONSE PLATFORM FOR THE SYRIA CRISIS

Since 2013, the Government of Jordan has taken a proactive role in seeking to respond to the impact 
of the Syrian crisis within a resilience framework by preparing the National Resilience Plan (NRP) 2014-
2016, which focused mainly on host communities. As of September 2014,the Jordan Response Platform 
for the Syria Crisis (JRPSC) was established to coordinate, guide and provide oversight to the preparation, 
implementation and monitoring of the Jordan response Plans. 

The JRPSC brings together high level representatives of the government, the donor community, UN 
agencies and the INGO community under one planning and coordination framework. Its mission is to 
ensure an effective, nationally-owned and coordinated response to the multi-facetted challenges faced 
by the country as a result of the Syria crisis. It is chaired by the Minister of Planning and International 
Cooperation (MOPIC) and supported by a dedicated Secretariat. To ensure coherence in the work of the 
JRPSC, the following 12 Task Forces (TFs) were established:

EDUCATIONENERGYENVIRONMENTFOOD SECURITYHEALTHJUSTICELIVELIHOODSMUNICIPAL SERVICES 
SHELTERSOCIAL PROTECTIONTRANSPORTWASHEach TF provides a forum for policy discussion and strategic decision-making for humanitarian and 
development partners from the government, UN agencies, donors and NGOs, to develop and implement a 
coherent sector wide response to the impact of the Syria crisis on Jordan. 

 The JRPSC and its TFs are supported by the JRPSC Secretariat, which works in close cooperation with MOPIC 
Humanitarian Relief Coordination Unit (HRCU) to ensure the timely and appropriate elaboration of the JRP 
by performing the following tasks:

..Policy advice and technical assistance to MOPIC in its functions as JRPSC chair; 
..Technical support and capacity development to MOPIC/HRCU on strategic planning; 
..Policy and capacity development assistance to MOPIC to (i) strengthen and maintain JORISS, the 
only integrated information management system for the JRP; (ii) set up and operate a monitoring 
and reporting system to improve aid-tracking, JRP partners’ accountability and coordination; (iii) 




strengthen a communication and advocacy strategy to enhance public awareness on challenges, 
progress and achievements of Jordan in responding to the crisis; (iv) coordinate the preparation and 
implementation of the Jordan Response Plan.


1.3 INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT TO JORDAN

Since the beginning of the crisis in 2011, UN humanitarian appeals were launched to ensure that Syrian 
refugees receive international assistance and are supported with essential protection services. As of 2015, 
Jordan has taken the leadership in the set-up of the response plan to the impact of the Syria crisis on the 
country by integrating humanitarian and development responses and resources to address the needs of 
both Syrian refugees and host communities. The JRP2015 and JRP 2016-18 represented a paradigm shift in 
this respect by bridging the divide between short-term refugee and longer-term developmental response 
within a resilience-based comprehensive framework. According to some researchers, the JRP is the most 
sophisticated response to the Syrian refugee crisis of all the major neighboring host countries.18 

In February 2016, at the “Supporting Syria and the Region” conference in London (hereafter, London 
Conference), the Government of Jordan took another ambitious and forward looking step ahead in dealing 
with the impact of the Syria crisis by signing the Jordan Compact. The Compact aims to turn the challenge 
of the massive presence of refugees in the country into a development opportunity that would benefit 
both Jordanians and Syrians. On one side concrete actions on livelihoods and jobs, as well as improved 
access to education are included, in order to give refugees the skills they need to rebuild Syria, hopefully in 
the near future. On the other side, improved access to the European market, grants and concessional loans 
are made available to Jordan to mitigate the impact of the crisis.

Although the London Conference has been able to mobilize a record amount of over US$ 11 billion in 
pledges for Syria and its neighbouring countries, only a share of what promised by the international 
community has been translated into real disbursements to mitigate the impact of the crisis on Jordan. 
In particular, although the international community has indeed helped Jordan, it has nevertheless fallen 
short of the needs and requirements defined in the JRP2016-18 and all its predecessor plans. This is 
emblematic of the failure of the orthodox model according to which host countries provide protection 
space to refugees while the costs are born by the international community. The flaw of this model lies 
in the fact that international law requires host countries not to expel people who face a genuine threat 
of persecution in their home country. Yet the international community has no legal obligation to offer 
financial support. 19 

As of 12 November 2016 , donors have committed a total of US$ 1.02 billion to the JRP for the year 2016, 
representing 37.5% of total requirements. Out of these resources, some US$325.9 million have been

THE JORDAN COMPACT

In its ongoing efforts to further improve its holistic response to the impact of the Syria Crisis, 
Jordan took yet another pioneering initiative by signing the Jordan Compact during the 2016 
‘Supporting Syria and the Region’ conference in London. Through the Jordan Compact, the 
government sought to transform the refugee crisis into a development opportunity that 
attracts new investments and opens up the EU market with simplified rules of origin, thus 
creating jobs for both Jordanians and Syrian refugees in a complimentary, non-competitive 
manner. Jordan has also been working hard to mobilize sufficient resources to secure access to 
formal education to 50,000 Syrian children by the next school year, and has issued more than 
32,000 work permits to Syrian refugees nationwide. 



provided directly to the Government’s general budget while US$465.6 million have been channelled to UN 
agencies, NGOs, technical cooperation agencies, private sector and academia and reported through the 
Jordan Information System for the Syria Crisis (JORISS). Some US$ 224 million have been instead received 
by some UN agencies.

1.4 THE JRP 2017 – 2019 PROCESS

The JRP 2017–19 was prepared, within the framework of the JRPSC, led by MOPIC in close cooperation 
with relevant line ministries, other government institutions and organizations, donors, UN agencies and 
NGOs. It is the result of a participatory planning process involving a wide range of stakeholders involved in 
the ongoing response to the Syria crisis in Jordan. The JRP 2017–19 builds on the approach and the work 
completed to produce the JRP2016-18. 

The Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment

Between April and July 2015, MOPIC/HRCU and the JRPSC Secretariat coordinated the elaboration of a 
Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment (CVA).20 The CVA aimed to clarify vulnerabilities among host 
communities and refugees (in and out of camps) and to assess the impact of the crisis on basic social 
services, such as education, health, solid waste management and water. The CVA was based on the 
information and results collected and reviewed by the TFs. 

For the preparation of the JRP2017-19, TFs were requested to review and update the information included 
in the CVA with any new relevant primary and secondary data and assessments within their sectors. Based 
on this analysis, each Task Force drafted one comprehensive sector assessment outlining the vulnerabilities 
and unmet needs. Sector contributions were reviewed and consolidated by the JRPSC Secretariat and 
served foundation for the JRP2017-19. Findings and analysis of the CVA2016 can be found in Chapter 2 of 
this document.

The Elaboration Process

JRP sector response plans were produced in a series of intensive working sessions with TFs, which 
culminated in a planning workshop held from 4 to 6 of October 2016 in the Dead Sea. Overall, some 
300 professionals from more than 87 institutions and organizations, including government officials, UN 
specialists, representatives of the donor community, and national and international NGOs participated in 
the elaboration of the JRP2017-19. 

Members of all 12 TFs worked intensively to (i) finalize their sector CVA; (ii) review their sector overall and 
specific objectives; (iii) identify and review projects for each specific objective; (iv) complete all project 
summary sheets (PSSs); (v) ensure harmonization and consistency within and among sectors.

As a result of the JRP workshop, Task Forces finalized a first draft of their sector response, including sector 
narrative and PSSs. PSSs, which are an annex of this document, incorporate detailed information, such as 
project budget, objective, key activities, location and beneficiary type. Also, a number of commonly agreed 
prioritization criteria are listed and ranked within each PSS thereby providing a source for prioritization of 
projects for each sector.

During the period between October and December, sector responses produced by the TFs were reviewed 
by MOPIC and the JRPSC Secretariat and discussed with the relevant line ministries.

1.5 SCOPE AND STRUCTURE OF THE PLAN

The JRP 2017–19 is a three-year plan that seeks to address the needs of Syrian refugees and Jordanians 
people, communities and institutions affected by the crisis. 

It integrates refugee and resilience responses into one comprehensive vulnerability assessment and one 
single plan for each sector, thereby placing the resilience of the people in need and of the national systems 
at the core of the response.

In order to maximise the possibilities of securing reliable and predictable funds to assist in the delivery of 
both short-term humanitarian and longer-term resilience-based interventions, the plan adopts a multi-year 
approach spanning 36 months. Like the JRP2016-18, the JRP2017-19 is also a rolling plan. This means that 
it will be revised and updated in 2017, when another planning year will be added and so on. It is expected 
that this will facilitate the provision of multi-year financing and the supervision of multi-year interventions. 

Finally, the JRP2017–19 is not conceived in an institutional vacuum but it is part of a wider national planning 
process that reflects the country’s longer term development vision. 

Harmonization with Existing Plans

The JRP2017–19 has been designed in alignment and complementarity with Jordan’s two main national 
plans and strategies: the Executive Development Programme (EDP) 2016–18, and the Governorates 
Development Programme (GDP) 2016–18. The EDP, which covers 26 sectors, is the midterm national 
development plan prepared under the Vision 2025 development strategy.21 The GDP sets out the current 
development situation and priorities of each governorate and proposes a list of projects to meet local level 
needs. 

MOPIC and the JRPSC Secretariat have requested TFs to ensure complementarities between the JRP and 
the other two plans. Guidelines were provided to clarify that the JRP remains a complementary plan, which 
comprehensively responds to the impact of the Syria crisis on the country. It is a stand-alone plan with 
distinct, crisis-specific objectives, partnerships and financing modalities. In this sense, both the GDP and 
the EDP have been shared with TF members for review while drafting their sector responses. Furthermore, 
most of the government staff participating in the JRP is also part of the committees for the preparation and 
monitoring of the EDP. 

Finally, a detailed comparison between the projects proposed for the EDP and the JRP was carried out 
by the JRPSC Secretariat, in close cooperation with MOPIC’s relevant departments and TF members, to 
review the objectives, activities, location, and budget for all projects. Duplicated projects were removed, 
and projects with overlapping objectives or activities have been amended and a clean list of the projects 
has been prepared for each sector. The total budget has been reduced accordingly.

JRP 2017 – 2019 Objectives

Given that the number and distribution of Syrian refugees in Jordan has not changed significantly over the 
past year, that international aid has fallen short of needs, and that prospects for a solution to the conflict 
remain slim, the objectives of this plan remain similar to the JRP2016-18. The education and livelihood 
sectors are the only two exceptions because of the paradigm-shift agreements made in the Jordan Compact.

21) The full EDP document is available at www.mop.gov.jo



Within a timeframe of three years (January 2017 – December 2019) the plan aims to: 

..Meet the immediate humanitarian needs of:
––Syrian refugees in and out of camps; 
––Vulnerable Jordanians affected by the Syria crisis; 



..Upscale critical capacities of the central, regional and local authorities to plan, program, coordinate 
and implement the development response, in order to manage and mitigate the impact of the crisis 
in a timely, efficient and effective manner. 
..Foster the resilience of: 
––The service delivery system, at the national and local levels, and mitigate the negative impacts 
on health, education, water and sanitation, in a cost-effective and sustainable manner;
––Municipal services and infrastructure in areas critically affected by demographic stress, 
including solid waste management, housing, and energy sectors, thereby advancing more cost 
effective and sustainable solutions. 



..Ensure that all Syrian children are in education; 
..Create new employment and livelihood opportunities for vulnerable Jordanians and Syrian 
refugees, and strengthen the coping mechanism of the most vulnerable segments affected by the 
crisis; 
..Address social imbalances and improve social cohesion in host communities; 
..Support the government budget to cope with the financial burdens resulting from the Syria crisis;
..Mitigate pressures on the natural resources, environment and ecosystem services;


The above-mentioned objectives are expected to be achieved in proportion to the financial resources the 
international community provides for the JRP.

Planning Assumptions

The plan is based on the following assumptions:

..The Syrian population in Jordan will grow by 3% a year and will therefore reach the total number of 
1.304 million in January 2017, 1.343 million in January 2018, and 1.383 in January 2019. This takes into 
consideration new arrivals and returnees as well as the natural population growth. 
..The total number of registered Syrian refugees is around 656,400, of which 141,000 reside in camps, 
while the rest remain in urban areas. The highest concentration of urban-dwelling refugees continues 
to be in the northern governorates and in Amman;
..The international community turns its pledges into real and trackable disbursements by adequately 
financing through grants the Jordan Response Plan, including the resilience of host communities. 22
..All partners commit to provide transparent and timely reporting on funding allocations, projects, 
activities and expenditures through JORISS.
..The international community will adhere to internationally agreed principles on aid effectiveness, 
recognizing country ownership, alignment and usage of national systems. Accordingly, the government 
will maintain and enhance an enabling environment for aid effectiveness and coordination.

CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES 

Capacity Development

All Task Forces have endeavoured to integrate capacity development of national actors and institutions 
at the core of their sector response strategies. Many interventions have integrated capacity development 
support and strengthening of national systems as part of their overall assistance. Capacity development 
indicators were also identified at sector specific objective level to ensure that capacity development is an 
integral part of the plan’s monitoring and evaluation framework.

Environmental Sustainability

Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) are mandatory in Jordan for projects in which environmental 
risks are foreseen, and for which mitigation measures and opportunities for sustainable solutions may be 
engaged. This is likely to be the case for a number of projects in the JRP2017–19 that address infrastructure 
development, transport, municipal development, land use and water and sanitation management. With 
guidance provided by the Ministry of Environment, UNDP and UNEP, an Environment Marker was included 
in JORISS to be used by all implementing partners for the JRP projects. This tool is expected to: 

..Raise awareness of key environmental vulnerabilities to help ensure they are not negatively 
impacted by humanitarian and resilience projects 
..Mainstream country specific environmental concerns across the JRP process
..Provide added value to the work of the JRP by enhancing environmental aspects of all projects.


Protection

Mainstreaming protection principles across JRP2017-19 sectors helps to ensure that programme activities 
promote and protect the wellbeing of affected Jordanians and Syrian refugees without contributing to 
discrimination, abuse, neglect or exploitation of any section of the population. 

In particular, TFs were expected to adopt the following guiding principles in the development of their 
respective response plans:

..Ensuring the provision of services for women, girls, boys and men (WGBM) based on the principles 
of equality and non-discrimination, paying particular attention to the most vulnerable, including 
elderly and disabled persons, unaccompanied girls and boys, households headed by women, girls 
and boys.
..Delivering protection and assistance in safety and with dignity by ensuring that the design (and 
implementation) of activities aims at reducing and mitigating protection risks. 
..Empowering and engaging with refugees and host communities by building the capacities of 
people to contribute to their own protection and that of their communities, supporting community-
based protection mechanisms and safety nets, and strengthening two-way communication with 
persons that might be excluded from the decision-making processes.
..Promoting accountability to affected populations, particularly by involving them in the design, 
monitoring and evaluation of programmes and reporting on the results.




Gender Equality

Gender equality is a critical crosscutting issue for the JRP2017-19, considering that 50.6% of the refugee 
population is composed of women.23

With guidance provided by the Jordanian National Commission for Women (JNCW) and UNWOMEN, the 
following steps have been adopted to mainstream gender throughout the plan: 

..Formulating results for gender equality within results-based frameworks;
..A gender-responsive budget per sector;
..IASC Gender Marker self-assessment in the JORISS system;


The JRP2017-19 will continue to use the gender marker in order to foster greater gender mainstreaming in 
implementing partners’ project formulation.

Other cross-cutting issues

In addition to the above, other cross-cutting issues that have been taken into consideration in drafting 
this plan include, but are not limited to: child, youth, private sector, and ICT for development. Child and 
youth issues were given particular attention throughout the plan, and their social, intellectual, professional 
and economic needs emphasized in the relevant sectors. The private sector is at the core of a number of 
responses, including in shelter, food security and livelihoods, local governance and municipal services, 
but also in health, energy and WASH. ICT is a prominent feature of the strategies in the education, health, 
livelihoods and food security, local governance and municipal services, and WASH sectors.

2.1 INTRODUCTION

With the Syrian conflict approaching its sixth year, Jordan continues to host an unprecedented number of 
Syrian refugees, and has long since exceeded its absorptive capacity. This complex and protracted conflict 
— which has potentially destabilizing effects for the Kingdom — requires an updated assessment of Syria 
crisis-related vulnerabilities, needs and priorities as the basis for a well-informed and evidence-based 
Jordan Response Plan 2017-2019.

The use of different vulnerability criteria among national and international stakeholders in Jordan has 
generated challenges in the analysis and interpretation of data and information, thereby limiting Jordan’s 
capacity to gain a comprehensive picture of Syria crisis-related vulnerabilities. In addition, many vulnerability 
measurements focus on hazards and risks rather than on capacities for addressing them, providing only 
part of the full picture of vulnerability.

 THIS COMPLEX AND PROTRACTED CONFLICT — WHICH HAS 
POTENTIALLY DESTABILIZING EFFECTS FOR THE KINGDOM — REQUIRES 
AN UPDATED ASSESSMENT OF SYRIA CRISIS-RELATED VULNERABILITIES, 
NEEDS AND PRIORITIES AS THE BASIS FOR A WELL-INFORMED AND 
EVIDENCE-BASED JORDAN RESPONSE PLAN 2017-2019.

MOPIC, with support from JRPSC Task Forces, has developed a Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment 
(CVA) to inform Jordan’s response to the impact of the Syria crisis on the country. The CVA identifies the 
vulnerabilities, needs and gaps in assistance to refugees and host communities, and seeks to measure the 
impact of the crisis on key public service sectors and their capacity to cope with the additional demand 
arising from the influx of refugees. The CVA thus stands to inform the development of the JRP by:

..Establishing a profile of vulnerability among (i) Syrian refugee households; (ii) Jordanian host 
communities; (iii) public service sectors such as education, health, municipal services, and water; and 
(iv) other JRP sectors.
..Improving targeting of assistance to inform the planning process of the JRP 2017-19 and use aid 
resources more effectively and equitably.


CHAPTER TWO

COMPREHENSIVE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT



2.2 METHODOLOGY 

This assessment is based on a desk review of a range of recent assessments, reports and evaluations, 
including the 2015 Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment prepared by the JRPSC.

Task Forces were responsible for reviewing and analysing the findings and results of any relevant primary 
and secondary data and assessments within their sectors including achievements and developments 
during the past year. Based on this analysis, Task Forces drafted their respective CVA sub-chapters outlining 
the vulnerabilities, needs, and gaps in assistance to host communities, refugees, and public sector services. 
MOPIC, with support from the JRPSC Secretariat, was responsible for reviewing and harmonizing all sector 
sub-chapters.

2.3 RESPONSE PLANS BY SECTOR 

2.3.1 EDUCATION

Sector Introduction 

Out of 656,400 Syrian refugees in Jordan, some 236,304 are school-aged children (117,306 boys; 118,998 
girls).24 By the end of the 2015/2016 school year, 145,458 Syrian refugee children were enrolled in public 
schools in camps and host communities, an increase of 16,104 students (12 percent) compared to the 
previous academic year.25 Meanwhile, around 170,000 Syrian refugee children have been enrolled in public 
schools for the school year 2016/2017.26 A total of around 90,846 Syrian children registered with UNHCR 
remain out of formal education, a figure that substantially increases to 118,840 children when calculations 
are based on the 2015 Census data.27 Many refugee households cannot cover the cost of education due 
to their increasingly fragile financial situation, with children living in northern and eastern regions being 
particularly affected. Around 47 percent of schools are crowded (as of 2015/2016), up from 36.6 percent 
in 2012/2013.28 As part of efforts to improve quality of education, an intensive planning exercise was 
conducted at school camps to decongest classrooms, the result of which was a 50 percent decrease in the 
teacher-student ratio by the start of 2015/2016 school year. 

AROUND 170,000 SYRIAN REFUGEE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN ENROLLED IN 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR THE SCHOOL YEAR 2016/2017.

Distance is a major barrier for younger children (grades 1-3) and female students, especially in the year 2016, 
as the second shift ends at 5:50PM instead of 5:30PM. Children with disabilities also experience challenges 
due to physical and cultural barriers and the lack of specialized staff to support their integration into 
schools. Enrolment rates amongst Syrian children remains low due to many not having the documentation 
required for registration. Furthermore, very few adolescent Syrians are enrolled in higher grades and their 
low academic achievements are a worrying trend. Assessments show that Syrian refugees, particularly those 
living in camps, are performing well below their Jordanian counterparts. Very few Syrian refugee students 
underwent the Tawjihi (Jordan’s general secondary examination) and even fewer passed. The pass rates of 
Syrian students continue to be significantly below that of the national average (32 percent Syrian average 
vs 44 percent national average for 2015/2016 academic year).29 Syrian youth have few opportunities to

continue their studies beyond secondary level or to apply their skills and knowledge in the labour market. 
Other barriers to education include the lack of a safe learning environment and low levels of engagement 
from communities. In addition to the above, there remains a substantial gap in financing the JRP and more 
specifically the Accelerated Plan under the Jordan Compact. 

Interventions Addressing Identified Needs and Vulnerabilities 

The Ministry of Education (MOE ) has focused on improving the access of Syrian children to formal education 
services. A significant portion of funding was used to strengthen the ability of the public education system 
to absorb Syrian refugees and to minimize the negative impact on both students and schools. System-wide 
support was provided in the form of direct financial support, teacher training, infrastructural support, and 
the provision of basic teaching and learning supplies. 

In order to quickly absorb the high number of Syrian children into public schools, double shifts were 
introduced in 98 schools in 2013-2014, in addition to another 102 schools in the year 2016/2017. In camps, 
4 additional school complexes will be established to accommodate refugee children. Schools underwent 
light refurbishments and are regularly maintained. Teachers were trained to manage diversity in the 
classroom, incorporate psychosocial service elements and provide care and instruction to children with 
disabilities. Syrian children benefit from additional out-of-classroom academic support that enable them 
to adjust to a new curriculum and boost their academic performance. 

THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION HAS FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE ACCESS 
OF SYRIAN CHILDREN TO FORMAL EDUCATION SERVICES. A SIGNIFICANT 
PORTION OF FUNDING WAS USED TO STRENGTHEN THE ABILITY OF THE PUBLIC 
EDUCATION SYSTEM TO ABSORB SYRIAN REFUGEES AND TO MINIMIZE THE 
NEGATIVE IMPACT ON BOTH STUDENTS AND SCHOOLS.

Children who are not eligible for formal education have access to alternative educational pathways. In the 
academic year 2016/2017, out-of-school children aged 9-12 will access the Catch-Up program, a new MOE-
certified education program. Children aged 13 and above, continue to access the NFE Drop Out program. 
Youth benefit from classes focused on post-basic numeracy, literacy and life skills, while youth centers 
are providing important spaces for youth to continue their education on both skill-focused and academic 
courses. A small percentage of youth also have access to post-basic and tertiary education opportunities in 
universities. However, the demand for tertiary education far exceeds the existing supply. 

Education Management Information System (EMIS) of the MOE was launched in August 2016 and is now 
operational nation-wide. The system will provide accurate data on the educational system in the country 
enabling evidence based planning and effective decision making at all MOE levels.

Unmet Needs and Vulnerabilities 

The 2015 Sector Vulnerability Assessment found that vulnerability is most severe in governorates with high 
concentrations of Syrian refugees, namely Amman, Zarqa, Irbid, and Mafraq. Statistically, 86 percent of this 
vulnerability is attributed to the additional demand. 

Construction of new schools and extensions/rehabilitations of existing educational infrastructure, including 
sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools, are needed to address the increasing demand for access. 
Demands for regular maintenance will also increase as double-shifting continues while renovation and 
construction projects are completed. In total, 2,800 new classrooms and 150 new schools are needed to 



ensure that there are sufficient facilities for all school-age children. The government has already established 
102 additional double-shifted schools for 50,000 children during the 2016-2017 school year, which has 
covered a portion of the needs. Despite its initial success in absorbing the Syrian student population, 
double-shifting has resulted in overcrowded schools and poor quality of education. More effective planning 
is needed to overcome overcrowding and distance related challenges. MOE is currently developing a GIS-
based school mapping tool which will aid in the rationalization exercises of school infrastructure projects 
nationwide. 

The cost of education remains high for many refugee households. Future interventions could help to 
decrease this cost through outreach, providing support for transportation cost and provision of school 
supplies are needed. Moreover, additional education opportunities such as remedial lessons delivered 
through learning support services are required so that refugee children can cope with difficulties in 
absorbing the school curriculum and enhance their academic performance. Future efforts should consider 
how to improve social cohesion between Jordanian and Syrian children as segregation has contributed to 
increased violence in schools. 

THE 2015 SECTOR VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT FOUND THAT 
VULNERABILITY IS MOST SEVERE IN GOVERNORATES WITH HIGH 
CONCENTRATIONS OF SYRIAN REFUGEES, NAMELY AMMAN, ZARQA, IRBID, 
AND MAFRAQ. STATISTICALLY, 86 PERCENT OF THIS VULNERABILITY IS 
ATTRIBUTED TO THE ADDITIONAL DEMAND.

The role of school leadership needs to be further enhanced to provide better support and supervision 
to teaching staff. Induction and capacity building beyond pedagogy for teachers and administration are 
necessary, particularly in the fields of psychosocial support, operational management, and providing 
support to school leadership. More training for all educators is required on providing for the specific needs 
of Children with Disabilities (CWD). 

Addressing the increasing demand for post-secondary educational opportunities for youth is necessary, 
particularly through the provision of diverse accredited arts, science, and technical education programmes, 
including higher education. Universities should be encouraged to provide more opportunities to 
accommodate Syrian students in tertiary education and reduce the burden of providing original 
documentation. 

Recommendations 

Response to the Syria crisis must continue to be: i) inclusive, as in meeting the needs of both vulnerable 
Jordanians and Syrian refugees in and outside the formal education system; ii) responsive to national 
demands for improved levels of service delivery; and iii) able to promote the long-term resilience of the 
education system to safeguard gains already made and to accelerate the implementation of quality-
focused reform strategies. 

As such, the response priorities are as follows: 

..Supporting the Government in providing quality education and establish protective learning 
environments, in addition to reducing overcrowding and enabling schools and staff to accommodate 
Syrian boys and girls who are out of school but still eligible for formal education; 
..Developing targeted interventions for boys and girls, adolescents and youth who remain out of 
school. Additionally, outreach efforts should endeavor to expand alternative education opportunities 




that lead back to formal education, adopting structured referral processes and certified pathways 
from non-formal education into formal schooling, according to MOE enrollment criteria; 
..Strengthening efforts to eliminate significant obstacles to the inclusion of boys and girls with 
disabilities into mainstream education through improved school infrastructure, provision of special 
education services and specialized trainings of teachers and caregivers; 
..Increasing opportunities with regards to access to secondary, post-secondary, tertiary and technical 
and vocational education for adolescents and the youth;
..Supporting the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE) to enable access for Syrian refugees who have 
the means to enroll in Higher Education programmes at universities, or who have benefitted from 
scholarships, while engaging the private sector to secure more scholarship opportunities in Jordan 
and abroad; 
..Addressing barriers to entry, including lack of documentation, lack of recognition of prior learning 
and financial limitations, in addition to promoting the proper application of skills and knowledge after 
completion of learning;
..Addressing cross-sectoral issues and potential barriers to education access for vulnerable refugee 
households, such as school violence, social tensions, poor WASH in schools, child labour and child 
marriage, and lack of financial resources; 
..Assisting MOE in strengthening its ability to respond to crises through capacity building 
opportunities, in addition to providing technical support to ensure school management teams and 
teachers have adequate skills and expertise to address the psychosocial needs of boys and girls, 
adolescents and youth, and to deliver quality education in a challenging context; 
..Supporting initiatives that encourage social cohesion between Jordanians and Syrians, including 
the relationships between parents, students, teachers, schools and various education providers. 




2.3.2 ENERGY 

Over 80% of refugees are settling in rural and urban areas of Jordan, contributing to an increase of total 
residential electricity consumption from 5548 GWh in 2011 to 6,938 GWh in 2015.30 Consumption of light 
petroleum gas (LPG) has increased from 370,000 in 2011 to 420,000 tonnes in 2015.31 Latest available 
statistics show that electricity consumption in the northern governorates, where most of the refugee 
population lives, have increased by 2.3% compared to other governorates in Jordan.32 

Population and commercial development inside Zaatari refugee camp cause the increasing of electricity 
and network evolution. Essential upgrades were implemented in June 2015, establishing safe and reliable 
individual household connections for nearly 80,000 residents. Improving living conditions remains a 
key objective in Azraq refugee camp, where a solar plant of 2 MW is under construction. The Electricity 
Distribution Company (EDCO) is finalizing the construction of a medium voltage network within the camp 
while a low voltage network is also under construction. 

Interventions Addressing Identified Needs and Vulnerabilities 

Approved energy projects reported in JORISS by August 2016 amounted to US$ 18,917,354. 

In host communities, projects to implement renewable energy and energy efficiency are ongoing. In Jerash 
and Irbid governorates, another project has been recently launched with the aim to implement replicable 
renewable energy pilot interventions that demonstrates economic feasibility, technical efficiency, and 
replicability. 

OVER 80% OF REFUGEES ARE SETTLING IN RURAL AND URBAN AREAS OF 
JORDAN, CONTRIBUTING TO AN INCREASE OF TOTAL RESIDENTIAL ELECTRICITY 
CONSUMPTION FROM 5548 GWH IN 2011 TO 6,938 GWH IN 2015.

New approaches to energy in urban settings are also being adopted. For instance, 
agreements will be developed with landlords renting to refugees in order to incentive the 
reduction of rent or electricity costs in return for energy improvements to buildings. This 
will involve the installation of increased insulation, upgraded glazing, upgrading electrical 
installations, solar water heating systems and other measures to improve efficiency and 
reduce overall energy costs. Energy efficient LED light bulbs are also being installed.

In refugee camps, several interventions are currently in place to mitigate the impact of insufficient energy 
resources such as the upgrade of electrical distribution networks in Zaatari and Azraq camps to increase 
system capacity and reliability. 

Unmet Needs and Vulnerabilities 

To meet the increased energy demands arising from the presence of Syrian refugees in host communities, 
there is a crucial need to accelerate energy efficiency and renewable energy measures in buildings and 
residences across Jordan. . Specific effort is needed to reduce the use of fossil fuels and pressures on the 
power grid. This can be done by establishing and upgrading the necessary infrastructure, transmission and

distribution for additional medium-term renewable energy generation. 

Refugees in rented accommodation face the additional burden of high utility bills, which could be 
mitigated through energy-efficiency measures, such as water-saving devices, increased insulation, solar 
water heating and energy-efficiency technologies.

WHILE PLANNING IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS ENERGY 
USAGE AMONGST REFUGEES, IT IS ALSO ESSENTIAL TO CREATE LONG-
TERM SOLUTIONS AND ENSURE ACCESS TO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY 
RESOURCES IN THE FUTURE.

Due to resource constraints in Zaatari camp, refugees are provided with limited hours of electricity supply. The 
transition to renewable energy resources, together with energy awareness campaigns, would undoubtedly 
provide a suitable basis to provide the needed energy more systematically. Further investigation into cost 
recovery mechanisms is required to create self-reliance and sustainability for the refugee community and 
organizations operating within the camp. Central solar power plants would provide an optimal sustainable 
solution to meet energy demands for thousands of people living and working in the camps.

Renewable energy technology could also meet hot water requirements necessary to improve health and 
hygiene for both urban and camp populations.

Recommendations

..Sustainable and renewable energy solutions can help reduce social and economic risks of growing 
energy insecurity in Jordan. It is highly recommended to meet extra energy loads by using energy 
efficiency and renewable energy solutions, while building on existing capacities and initiatives. 
..The following interventions are recommended:
..Installation of solar water heaters in buildings and residences;
..Replacing inefficient lights in residences and buildings with new compact fluorescent (CFLs) and 
light-emitting diode (LED) lamps;
..Promoting the use of energy efficient appliances in host communities; 
..Distribution, installation, and operations of PV solar panel systems in host communities; 
..Development of capacity building programs for the Ministry, municipal government, and relevant 
staffs on technical issues.


While planning immediate solutions to address energy usage amongst refugees, it is also essential to create 
long-term solutions and ensure access to sustainable energy resources in the future based on the following 
recommendations: 

..In camps, provide an adequate energy for every household needs.
..In urban areas, interventions should be focused on implementing the use of safe, renewable 
energy sources and energy efficient technologies at household level. The significance of ensuring 
energy sustainability within the refugee shelters of vulnerable groups is gaining an increasing focus.33 
..Raise awareness about safety measures concerning electricity and gas installations and the use of

by integrating energy saving” components into the shelter response, linked to negotiated reduction in rent and security of tenure.



insulation in urban shelters to reduce household energy costs.

..Create a renewable and cost-effective source of electricity through a central solar power plant in 
both camps. 
..Build a complete electrical network in Azraq Camp over three years (2017-2019), similar to those 
found in a normal urban setting of 60,000 people.
..Proper maintenance and upgrades of the electrical system will continue in Zaatari Camp.
..Implementing additional phases of Zaatari camp’s energy strategy will increase access, sustainability 
and safety of the electricity network, ensuring the dignity of refugees and advancing life-choices.


Pending the completion of the above work, the international community continues to cover the electricity 
bills for both Zaatari and Azraq camps and the maintenance of electricity network and solar power plants. 



2.3.3 ENVIRONMENT 

The increased population resulting from the influx of Syrians has affected Jordan’s ecosystem, air quality 
and waste management, particularly with regards to the following:

..Ecosystem Services and Land Degradation: There is an increasing trend of environmental 
related violations to compensate for higher fuel prices and overgrazing of livestock due to the high 
cost of fodder. For instance, the number of cases that reached courtrooms up to mid-2015 was an 
unprecedented 299 cases, of which 162 involved illegal wood cutting and 60 involved forest fires. 
..Air Quality: The Syria crisis is driving a sharp increase in air-polluting emissions. Air quality has 
been monitored in four areas vulnerable to air pollution near Syrian refugee clusters, and it is clear 
that the concentration of such large numbers of refugees in northern governorates is increasing the 
volume of emissions. 
..Hazardous Waste: The Swaqa landfill has been serving as a dumping site for a wide variety of 
hazardous waste, including medical and pharmaceutical waste. Currently, the site is in need of clean-
up and rehabilitation due to waste accumulation over the past few years. 
..Environment Mainstreaming: Currently, there is no mechanism in place to ensure proper integration 
of environmental aspects into JRP projects. However, an environmental screening procedure for all 
JRP projects shall be established according to national environmental regulations.


Interventions Addressing Identified Needs and Vulnerabilities 

Due to lack of funding made available by the international community, no interventions have been 
implemented or initiated to mitigate the environmental impact of the Syria crisis. Nonetheless, a first-stage 
rapid assessment of the impact on the environment in Jordan caused by the influx of Syrians has been 
conducted and focused on the following five priorities: water quantity and quality; soil degradation and 
rangelands; biodiversity and ecosystem services; air pollution; and hazardous and medical waste. 

THE INCREASED POPULATION RESULTING FROM THE INFLUX OF SYRIANS HAS 
AFFECTED JORDAN’S ECOSYSTEM, AIR QUALITY AND WASTE MANAGEMENT. 
DUE TO LACK OF FUNDING MADE AVAILABLE BY THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY, NO INTERVENTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED OR INITIATED TO 
MITIGATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE SYRIA CRISIS.

The rapid assessment, which is expected to inform a future comprehensive environmental assessment and 
definition of offset programmes, revealed that natural capital in Jordan is under additional pressure due 
to the influx of Syrian refugees. This is having particularly serious consequences on water and air quality 
indicators and on forests. Furthermore, water over-abstraction and increased wastewater generation has 
resulted in accelerated mining of renewable groundwater resources and pressures on treatment plants.

Unmet Needs and Vulnerabilities 

The importance of environmental risk is identified as a priority in the JRP2016-18 as well as in the Guidance 
on a Resilience Based Approach to Development for the Syria Crisis (2014) developed by the Regional 
United Nations Development Group (UNDG). The JRP, in particular, recommended an expanded analysis 
of the environmental implications of projects and programmes implemented within the framework of the 
Syria crisis.



The economic evaluation of the direct and indirect impact of refugees on the ecosystems of host regions of 
Jordan would lead to an important policy document that would aid in the decision-making process. 

Currently, there is no proper monitoring framework in place, which makes it difficult for the Government 
to monitor air quality and waste flow. Moreover, the Ministry of Environment does not have a database 
system for maintaining records of all air parameters and the types and amounts of waste. 

In Zaatari camp and surrounding areas, which have experience a substantial increase in human population 
and activities over the last few years, there is no facility that measures air quality and emissions. This should 
be urgently addressed in order to avoid possible health consequences for the local population. Overall, the 
treatment of hazardous waste is challenged by lack of human capacities, equipment, proper installations, 
databases, and proper monitoring programs. 

Recommendations 

The following actions are recommended to be undertaken to overcome current vulnerabilities and needs: 

..Creating additional alternative income generation opportunities, particularly for women and the 
youth. This will help offset the extra competition on natural resources and ecosystem services; 
..Enhancing enforcement of wildlife protection laws; 
..Strengthening the capacities for measuring air quality, especially in areas close to refugee hosting 
communities and camps. This should include strengthening human capacities, equipment and field 
monitoring;
..Enhancing the performance efficiency of wastewater treatment plants, factories, and other emitting 
facilities;
..Enhancing the capacities of collection, transport, and disposal of different types of hazardous 
waste. This includes building the human capacities and the provision of needed equipment; 
..Cleaning up and rehabilitate the existing landfill, through export of hazardous waste from Swaqa 
to be disposed outside the country under Basel convention procedures;
..Identifying the necessary technical and financial support for the establishment of treatment units 
for hazardous waste at Swaqa site;
..Developing a comprehensive and sustainable management approach for hazardous waste from 
source to Swaqa landfill in Jordan.


Furthermore, the need to reduce environmental vulnerability to shocks induced by the Syria crisis should 
be approached through designing and implementing environmental and ecosystem resilience-building 
interventions within the JRP framework, focusing on the following:

..Developing environmental screening procedures within the JRPSC for all JRP projects prior to 
implementation and in cooperation with the Ministry of Environment. This should also include training 
for implementing partners on environment screening procedures; 
..Undertaking rapid environment impact assessments (EIAs) for high level JRP risk projects and 
suggesting mitigation options according to Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) regulation no. 
37/2006;
..Providing support for identification of appropriate clean technology solutions in JRP response 
projects across infrastructure, municipal development, livelihoods, water, and other sectors.




2.3.4 FOOD SECURITY 

Jordan is largely a food secure country. Nationwide, 0.5 percent of all households in Jordan are food insecure, 
and an additional 13 percent of households are vulnerable to food insecurity.34 WFP’s 2016 CFSME reveals 
that the majority (72 percent) of Syrian refugee households living within host communities continue to be 
either food insecure or vulnerable to food insecurity. While this is an improvement from 2015, when these 
levels peaked at 85 percent, food security has not returned to 2014 levels, when 48 percent of households 
were found to be either vulnerable to food insecurity or food insecure.35 This slight improvement in food 
security amongst the Syrian refugee population could be explained by the fact that, in 2016, food assistance 
levels have remained stable compared to the previous year.36

Similar to gains seen in food consumption scores, a higher percentage of households in host communities 
(72 percent) have an optimal diet than in 2015 (63 percent). While this is an improvement compared to the 
previous year, it still suggests that over one-fourth (28 percent) of Syrian refugees are consuming a sub-
optimal diet. In order to maintain access to food, a greater proportion of refugee households (84 percent 
in 2016 compared to 75 percent in 2015) are continuing to rely on less preferred and less expensive foods. 

JORDAN IS LARGELY A FOOD SECURE COUNTRY. NATIONWIDE, 0.5 PERCENT OF 
ALL HOUSEHOLDS IN JORDAN ARE FOOD INSECURE, AND AN ADDITIONAL 13 
PERCENT OF HOUSEHOLDS ARE VULNERABLE TO FOOD INSECURITY.

Food insecurity for refugees in host communities continues to be driven by the depletion of assets to meet 
their food needs. On average, refugee households have a total of JOD 8 in savings. Limited savings amongst 
Syrian refugees can further explain why almost one-third (31 percent) of households have missed a rent 
payment on at least one occasion in the past six months. Poor purchasing power has forced nearly half of 
refugee households (49 percent) to buy food on credit or borrowed money from family or friends within 
the previous 30 days to meet their food needs. The perpetual use of these livelihood coping strategies 
further explains why the average debt per refugee household has risen from JOD 670 in 2015 to JOD 715 
in 2016. Furthermore, households that are food insecure or vulnerable to food insecurity have increasingly 
reduced their essential non-food expenditures to meet their food needs. This finding underscores how 
food security impacts other sectors such as education and health. 

Jordan is a net-food importing country, with 81 percent of its food requirements procured externally. 
Nevertheless, annual growth in production in the agriculture sector has reached 18 percent in 2014, 
contributing to 1.6 percent of total jobs created in the same year, thereby increasing access to food.37 

The Vision 2025 strategy and the national Agricultural Development Strategy identified the general 
challenges of food security and agriculture, which are: fluctuations in the international prices of basic 
commodities; disruptions of export routes; and increased consumption levels and prices. In response, the 
strategy identified 209 projects, initiatives and programmes in the field of food security for the coming ten 
years, with the objective of increasing agricultural production growth from 18 to 24 percent and creating 
65,000 job opportunities.

Interventions Addressing Identified Needs and Vulnerabilities 

Since the beginning of the Syria crisis, the food security sector has provided continual support to Syrian 
refugees inside and outside the camps. The largest portion of assistance is provided by a variety of 
organizations through food vouchers, while assistance to Jordanians has primarily sought to enhance food 
security and resilience through training, job creation activities and in-kind support.

USD 264,739,658 has been approved under the refugees and resilience components of the JRP 2015 under 
the combined Food Security and Livelihoods sector. Support activities included in-kind food distribution; 
monthly food voucher distributions; ad-hoc distribution to Syrian refugee families and vulnerable 
Jordanians in host communities; and targeted assistance during the month of Ramadan, amongst others. 

In 2016, some 523,959 Syrians and 65,255 Jordanians benefitted from food assistance via WFP projects, 
with a daily caloric intake benchmark of 2,100 Kcal per person. Under the school feeding programme, 
some 25,000 Syrian students in camps received school snacks, while 797 Syrians benefitted from training 
on good nutritional practices. Additionally, more than 20,000 Jordanians received support through cash for 
work, cash for training and micro-business support.38 

FAO has sought to address the impact of the Syrian crisis in host communities by promoting safe food 
production and conservation in households, and monitoring of food security in host communities. One 
of such project aims to increase access to safe and nutritious food, benefiting 3,069 Syrian and Jordanian 
beneficiaries in host communities.

Unmet Needs and Vulnerabilities 

“Vision 2025” identified a number of priorities under food security, including the increase of local food 
production and storage capacities of strategic food commodities, and a review of the subsidy reform 
policy. Moreover, inflation has had a negative effect on the food security situation for Syrian refugees and 
host communities. Between 2010 and 2015, the consumer price index for goods and services increased 
by 116.4 percent, while the index for agricultural and food commodities increased by 115.1 percent. This 
inflation has contributed to diminishing purchasing power and an increase in the number of vulnerable 
Jordanians and Syrian refugees.39 

Organizations working in the food security sector are responding to enhance access to food through 
livelihood interventions. While there will be a gradual transition from emergency assistance to livelihood 
assistance over the coming years, a vulnerable segment of the beneficiary population will remain dependent 
on emergency assistance. 

In addition, the continued prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies and poor dietary diversity, particularly 
among children, requires increased awareness on good nutritional practices. This should be combined 
with sufficient access to fresh food, which is still a challenge considering the limited economic resources of 
Syrian refugees.

The key natural resource challenges are climate change; water scarcity; desertification and urbanization; 
overgrazing; and population growth, which lead to decreased productivity and increased competition for 
land, water and food. 

Agricultural activity plays an important role in alleviating food insecurity and vulnerability of families. The 
sale of agricultural products provides additional income to enhance food access. Only 4 percent of food-
insecure and vulnerable households owns livestock, and 3.8 percent practiced cultivation activities in less 
than one dunum.40

Overall, the priority is ensuring that Syrian refugees have sufficient economic resources to access food, 
without employing negative coping strategies in the process. 

Recommendations 

Given on-going levels of food insecurity and dependence on food assistance amongst Syrian refugee and 
host communities, the following is recommended:

..Continuing programs that provide food assistance to the most vulnerable refugees in a safe and 
dignified manner, while gradually increasing self-reliance opportunities for refugees following the 
adoption of the Jordan Compact; 
..Supporting the government in reviewing legislation relevant to natural resources, food security 
and those with overlapping mandates;
..Enhancing food security of Syrian refugees and host communities through support for food value 
chain activities; 
..Expanding the provision of healthy school meals to a wider network of schools in host communities 
and to children studying in refugee camps. 
..Increasing awareness among Syrian and host communities on good nutritional practices;
..Promoting dietary diversity in camps through enhanced self-reliance and local food production;
..Promoting local agricultural production and marketing channels to provide high quality food 
commodities to Syrian refugees and host communities;
..Supporting and expanding the capacity of households and communities in urban and rural areas to 
establish family farming activities to improve dietary diversity, in addition to enhancing food security 
with special attention to female-headed households; and
..Promoting climate-smart agricultural technologies and practices, especially the water, food and 
energy nexus, to improve availability, access and quality of food.




2.3.5 HEALTH

The influx of Syrian refugees has placed ever increasing demands on the national health system, where one 
third of the Jordanian population does not have access to universal health insurance coverage.41 Meanwhile, 
Jordan has undergone a significant epidemiological transition towards non-communicable diseases 
(NCDs) in recent years, whereby premature NCDs mortality has increased compared to the global average.42 
Jordan is also experiencing a declining crude death rate and changing population demographics.43 This 
demographic shift is placing an increasing burden on healthcare services, with increased rates of NCDs, 
disability, and mental health problems.44 Health indicator values have decreased in 2015 and significant 
vulnerabilities still exist for maternal and child health, in addition to a shortage of human resources in the 
health sector.45

The Syrian refugee health profile reflects a country in transition with a high burden of NCDs.46 While much 
has been achieved in communicable disease control,47 antenatal and postnatal care coverage is suboptimal 
and reproductive health services remain critical.48 Although acute malnutrition is not a direct public 
health problem, micronutrient deficiencies are common in children under five years of age and women of 
reproductive age.49 Due to funding constraints, as of November 2014, non-camp refugees have had to pay 
the rate paid by uninsured Jordanians to receive health services. This is posing a significant problem for 
vulnerable refugees.50 A recent survey has shown that the majority of non-camp refugees with NCDs (58 
percent) were unable to access needed medicines or other health services, primarily due to an inability to 
pay fees.51 Use of private medical facilities has increased, with 64 percent first seeking care in the private 
sector. 

THE INFLUX OF SYRIAN REFUGEES HAS PLACED EVER INCREASING 
DEMANDS ON THE NATIONAL HEALTH SYSTEM, WHERE ONE THIRD OF THE 
JORDANIAN POPULATION DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO UNIVERSAL HEALTH 
INSURANCE COVERAGE.

Interventions Addressing Identified Needs and Vulnerabilities

As of June 2016, MoH has been able to mobilize USD 25.8 million from different countries’ funds, including 
USD 19.6 million already received to support resilience activities. These resources have been allocated to 
strengthen construction and rehabilitation of healthcare facilities in the governorates of Irbid, Mafraq, 
Zarqa, Balqa, Amman and Jerash governorates, as well as to provide medical equipment and ambulances to 
various hospitals and healthcare centers. Other 2016 planned and ongoing health resilience interventions 
targeting areas with high concentration of Syrian refugees include:

services.


The 2016 JRP also sought to ensure targeted interventions for refugees from the moment they arrive in 
Jordan. This included responding to the immediate health needs of new arrivals, and the subsequent access 
to comprehensive primary and essential secondary and tertiary health services. In this sense, support 
is being provided to community health volunteers and Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) facilities 
within the urban areas of Za’atari and Azraq. Mental health services are provided through PHC clinics and 
community mental health workers. Sexual and reproductive health services are provided, including clinical 
management of rape . Essential secondary and tertiary health services are also being provided to refugees 
on a continual basis. These services include support for war-related injuries, acute medical and surgical 
conditions, and direct/indirect provision of obstetric and neonatal services. 

THE 2016 JRP ALSO SOUGHT TO ENSURE TARGETED INTERVENTIONS FOR 
REFUGEES FROM THE MOMENT THEY ARRIVE IN JORDAN. THIS INCLUDED 
RESPONDING TO THE IMMEDIATE HEALTH NEEDS OF NEW ARRIVALS, AND 
THE SUBSEQUENT ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE PRIMARY AND ESSENTIAL 
SECONDARY AND TERTIARY HEALTH SERVICES. 

Unmet Needs and Vulnerabilities

Findings from the health sector vulnerability assessment (SVA) indicate that services to 22 percent of 
the population may be inadequate due to the fact that their local comprehensive health centers serve 
more people than the national standard of one center per 60,000 people . 87 percent of this vulnerability 
can be considered as a result of the influx of Syrians. There is an ongoing need to further strengthen the 
MoH through support for consumables, equipment, infrastructure, and human resources, and to promote 
resilience within the national health system. These measures are required to cope with intensified demand 
for health services from refugees, changing population demographics, and changing epidemiology of 
disease (i.e. non-communicable disease).

Due to limited available funds, only 40 percent of refugees living in urban settings are currently covered by 
health services, leaving over 300,000 people with uncertain access. The Vulnerability Assessment Framework 
(VAF) found that 41 percent of Syrian refugees are part of households with severe health vulnerability and 15 
percent are part of households with high health vulnerability.52,53 Moreover, the VAF found that 15 percent 
of Syrian refugees have difficult access to health services; 16 percent of households have the presence of 
pre-existing medical conditions (e.g. disabilities or chronic illnesses) that are negatively impacting a family 
member’s day-to-day life, and 10% of Syrian refugee households report that they spend more than 25% of 
their expenditure on healthcare. 54

..The following areas need to be tackled in order to mitigate vulnerabilities that face the health 
sector and improve the response to ongoing population needs:
..More effective and better integrated health services;
..Higher performance and better supported health workforce;
..A well-functioning health information system;
..Equitable access to essential medical supplies, vaccines, and technologies;
..An inclusive and accessible health financing system for vulnerable Jordanians and Syrians;
..Maintaining the access to immediate health services for new arrivals;
..Provide long-term access to comprehensive essential health services for all camp refugees and for 
those who are vulnerable and unable to afford access to essential services.


Recommendations

The following recommendations are provided for the CVA. They are aligned with the National Strategy of 
Health Sector in Jordan 2015 – 2019, the Jordan 2025 National Vision and Strategy, and the Health Sector 
Humanitarian Response Strategy. 

..Supporting the provision of high quality and integrated health services that can respond to the 
growing needs of a changing demography and epidemiology among population, including the 
expansion of infrastructure capacity, the support of integrated quality primary/secondary health care; 
strengthening the capacity of emergency services (including in borders areas); and the development 
of a strategic program to control non-communicable and communicable diseases; 
..Developing and increasing capacities of human resources for health, particularly in the medical 
specialties of intensive care, neonatal care, and mental health;
..Establishing effective, interoperable health information systems, including the implementation 
of maternal and perinatal death surveillance and strengthening national routine public health 
surveillance;
..Maintaining equitable access to essential medical supplies, vaccines, and technologies, including 
the assessment of micronutrient deficiency; strengthened monitoring of national flour fortification 
program; supporting the provision of family planning commodities; a Minimal Initial Service Package 
(MISP); Clinical Management of Rape (CMR) for Sexual and Reproductive health; and ensuring the 
availability of non-communicable disease medicines and vaccines for routine immunisation;
..Delivering strong leadership and governance with effective oversight and accountability, 
including the establishment of effective partnerships with private and public sectors; developing 
evidence-based plans, policies, and decisions for disaster risk reduction and preparedness; increasing 
community participation and sub-national governance, transparency, and accountability to improve 
delivery of quality health services;
..Maintaining humanitarian programming and continuing to meet the immediate health needs of 
individual refugees whilst also undertaking health systems strengthening and promoting resilience;
..Supporting a network of clinics and other services for Syrians who cannot access MoH services at 
the subsidised rate; 
..Supporting essential secondary and tertiary care, including emergency obstetrics, neonatal care, 
war wounds, malignancies, and other disorders not covered by MoH;

health services such as delivery care;
..Strengthening the prevention, screening, early diagnosis and treatment of certain malignancies;
..Expanding psychosocial support and symptomatic relief including pain management;
..Continue enhancing coordination and referral mechanisms, both across the health sector and with 
other sectors. 




2.3.6 JUSTICE 

The justice sector in Jordan has faced numerous challenges since the beginning of the Syria crisis. While 
violence and criminality levels in Jordan are low, data provided by the Public Security Directorate (PSD) 
shows that the northern region has witnessed an increase in criminal acts, assaults, and proliferation of 
small arms.55 As of August 2016, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has registered 7,123 cases involving Syrian 
refugees.56 The increased caseload involving Syrian refugees has pushed the courts beyond their technical 
and operational capacities, negatively impacting their performance and reducing their ability to ensure a 
fair trial. 

For instance, in 2014 and 2015, due to the increasing depletion of resources, the reduction in humanitarian 
assistance in urban areas, and the administrative and financial challenges related to obtaining formal work 
permits, there was an increase in detention cases for working without a permit. In February 2016, the 
Government announced that they would grant up to 200,000 work permits for Syrian refugees over a 3 
year period, thus creating new opportunities for Syrian refugees to earn a livelihood. Difficulties in gaining 
access to justice have a direct impact on safety and social cohesion.

Many Syrian refugees in Jordan lack important civil documentation such as birth, marriage, and death 
certificates. This is often because their documents were lost or damaged in Syria or they have not obtained 
documents in Jordan due to lack of awareness of both the need for such documents and the government 
procedures for obtaining them, particularly as the processes are designed for the births, marriages and 
deaths of Jordanian citizens and not the unusual circumstances faced by Syrians.57 As many Syrian refugees 
have married informally in Syria, they must first obtain ratification of their marriage through a Jordanian 
court order before they can obtain a birth certificate for any children born in Jordan from the marriage. The 
lack of birth certificates affects the ability of many Syrian refugee children to obtain health and educational 
services. While the ongoing recovery of Syrian personal identity documents and the regular presence of a 
civil registrar in refugee camps has improved access to birth registration, it is estimated that 30 percent of 
Syrian refugee children still do not have birth certificates.58 

THE JUSTICE SECTOR IN JORDAN HAS FACED NUMEROUS CHALLENGES 
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE SYRIA CRISIS. WHILE VIOLENCE AND 
CRIMINALITY LEVELS IN JORDAN ARE LOW, DATA PROVIDED BY THE 
PUBLIC SECURITY DIRECTORATE (PSD) SHOWS THAT THE NORTHERN 
REGION HAS WITNESSED AN INCREASE IN CRIMINAL ACTS, ASSAULTS, AND 
PROLIFERATION OF SMALL ARMS.

Furthermore, Shari’a courts have faced such caseload increases since the beginning of the crisis that the 
Chief Justice has ruled to extend the working days of some Shari’a courts by two hours.59 There are 14 civil 
court judges and 26 Shari’a court judges trained on refugee law and protection of refugees, and 25 juvenile 
and Shari’a court judges who were trained on the formalization of alternative care procedures for Syrian 
UASC (Unaccompanied asylum seeker children). Administrative institutions and practices in refugee camps 
have been strengthened, with the establishment of offices of the Shari’a court in Za’atari and Azraq camps.

The 2016-18 Jordan Response Plan (JRP) highlighted the difficulties in obtaining free legal aid. Although 
legal aid is granted through the Bar Association’s 1972 law, in practice it remains a challenge, particularly 
for vulnerable groups like women and children.60 Courts are only mandated to grant legal representation 
for adults in criminal cases entailing the death penalty or life imprisonment. 

Interventions Addressing Identified Needs and Vulnerabilities 

A number of projects and interventions are being implemented. Not all of them are currently uploaded on 
JORISS:

..The project ‘Enhancing Community Security and Access to Justice in Host Communities and other 
Fragile Areas in Jordan’ runs from 2015 to 2018 and has two main outputs: i) enhancing community 
security and cohesion in host communities and strengthening capacities to prevent crime and reduce 
violence; ii) improving access to justice, legal aid and counselling in host communities and other 
critical areas in Jordan, while supporting the institutionalization of a legal aid framework. 
..A project on strengthening the institutional capacity of law enforcement agencies (judiciary, 
prosecutors and police) in the field of criminal investigation is also being implemented. It aims to 
deter and prevent different forms of organized crime, with a focus on vulnerable groups. This project 
is being implemented in partnership with the Judicial Council, Public Security Directorate, National 
Center for Human Rights, and other national organizations. The project contributes to enhancing 
the investigative capacities and cooperation between the Prosecution’s Office and the police, thus 
ensuring full respect of human rights standards. 
..More than 1,200 judicial and PSD staff have been trained on criminal investigation in line with 
international standards and human rights principles, focusing on juvenile justice, trafficking in persons, 
and other forms of organized crime. Additionally, four juvenile police branches in Amman, Zarqa and 
Mafraq have been established to enable the police to provide adequate and responsive services in line 
with international standards. 
..The Ministry of Justice and the judiciary system have been provided with financial support to 
address long term resilience needs of Syrian refugees. The same has been done with several legal aid 
organizations with the objective of: 
––Further enhancing the capacity and independence of judicial power and impartiality of the 
judiciary by supporting the Justice Reform and Good Governance Programme, which focuses on 
criminal justice reform, penitentiary reform, juvenile justice reform and strengthening the capacity 
of the Anti-Corruption Commission; 
––Upgrading technical competencies; 
––Strengthening administrative capacity; 
––Providing technical assistance and support to civil society; 
––Supporting capacity building within the Ministry of Justice and the Judicial Council; 
––Providing support on case management, drafting of legislation, and ensuring that international 
standards are properly transposed in national legislation;
––Developing secondary legislation and rules and procedures as part of a better legislative 
framework to ensure proper access to justice on the basis of the rule of law; 
––Supporting policies that promote gender equality and more protection of vulnerable groups 
such as juvenile and persons with disabilities; 
––Supporting awareness programs for the public on justice sector reform and services through 
media, social media and the Internet; 





60) According to several studies: in 2011 it was found that 68 percent of defendants in Jordan did not have legal representation, and in pre-trial 
cases 83 percent of defendants did not have legal representation (Justice Center); another study found that women are more likely than men – 26 
percent versus 17 percent – to report avoiding court due to customs and traditions (World Bank, 2013). Social pressure also steers women from initiating 
claims directly with formal institutions. Nearly 70 percent of requests for legal aid assistance come from women (Justice Center for Legal Aid).



––Supporting the National Investment Plan for the Justice Sector, which should enhance the 
functions of the courts and the services towards the public. 
––Providing ongoing support for policies and procedures for reducing pre-trial detention and 
detention times for repeat offences and convictions. 


..Technical and financial support to NGOs and CSOS has also been provided, supporting MOJ’s efforts 
toward establishing a unit to set up a national legal aid system and provide information, counseling 
and a legal assistance programme to refugees and vulnerable Jordanians in host communities. Direct 
and legal assistance for Syrian workers and victims of human trafficking is also provided.


ALTHOUGH LEGAL AID IS GRANTED THROUGH THE BAR ASSOCIATION’S 1972 
LAW, IN PRACTICE IT REMAINS A CHALLENGE, PARTICULARLY FOR VULNERABLE 
GROUPS LIKE WOMEN AND CHILDREN.”

Unmet Needs and Vulnerabilities 

..The growing demand for justice support through the Ministry of Justice must be accompanied 
by institutional capacity building to the judiciary, prosecutors, and the Bar Association through 
governmental legal aid and other legal aid service providers. This will enable Jordan to meet 
international standards in dealing with people in need of judicial assistance, including providing legal 
services to refugees;
..Many courthouses – particularly in Amman and Irbid – urgently need new equipment, maintenance, 
and renovation in order to deliver proper services;
..Governmental and non-governmental dispute resolution mechanisms and actors capable of 
contributing to dispute resolution within host communities need to be identified and mapped, and 
their capacity needs to be strengthened;
..There is a need for Governmental policies and legal frameworks through the MOJ, which will 
establish better Access to justice for women with particular challenges, including gender-based 
violence (GBV) and domestic violence. Due to the sensitivity of the subject, women are less likely 
to report disputes and when they do they are more likely to go to court unrepresented. As part of 
a broader multi-sector response, greater efforts are needed to ensure the provision of quality legal 
services to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence;
..Women also face different types of legal disputes than men, and often find themselves having to 
claim rights under the Personal Status Code/ Family Law before Shari’a Courts. Family Law, however, 
does not provide equal rights to men and women, especially with regards to marriage, polygamy, 
and guardianship of the children. Unequal rights are exacerbated by difficulties accessing legal aid 
support; 
..The is a need to further strengthen the role of the MOJ in outreach and awareness raising activities 
and services, and to enhance access to justice, which is now also impeded by a lack of information and 
legal awareness, scarcity of resources, and inability to travel to courts.61 As a result, defendants in the 
majority of criminal court cases are not represented by a lawyer; 
..There is still a need to increase the knowledge of legal rights among members of vulnerable 
communities and the availability of legal aid services, especially in remote and under-served areas;


61) World Bank, Jordan Country Gender Assessment: Economic Participation, Agency and Access to Justice in Jordan, July 2013



..Encouraging vulnerable communities, especially women, to seek legal assistance remains a 
challenge;
..Ways of strengthening the best interests’ determination evaluation for early marriage applications 
as contained in the special instructions issued by the Supreme Judge Department should be examined, 
as recommended at the roundtable on early marriage and documentation issues held in June 2014;
..Specific legal awareness and civil documentation activities are needed to assist refugees to: (i) 
participate in the urban re-registration exercise (delivery of new MOI Service Cards); (ii) document 
marriages, deaths and births and (iii) ensure security of tenure.


Recommendations 

..Enhancing the capacities of MOJ and all affected courts in host communities and its administrations 
to address the increased demand, especially in Azraq, Ramtha, Mafraq, and Irbid, either by reutilizing 
existing space or building new courthouses;
..Enhancing the capacity of judges and prosecutors to respond to specific needs of different 
population groups through specialized thematic training and enhanced judiciary studies, and through 
the recruitment of new judges and support staff to address newly emerging crimes, such as trafficking 
and other cases of exploitation;
..Supporting the Judicial Training Institute to a)revamp its curricula to respond to knowledge gap 
and needs in courts based in host communities; and b) intensify its training programs for judges and 
other judicial personnel serving in host communities;
..Supporting the policies and legal framework of governmental legal aid in criminal cases and other 
legal aid services —particularly for felonies, and strengthening the efforts of civil society organizations 
in extending such services to impoverished and vulnerable communities;
..Enhancing the current governmental system for legal aid with tools to operationalize their legal aid 
and legal counselling mechanisms, which also includes other national legal aid mechanisms;
..Strengthening the efforts of MOJ and the Bar Association to amend legislation and issue bylaws to 
regulate legal aid, in addition to strengthening the provision of pro-bono services by members of the 
Jordanian Bar Association; 
..Increasing access to justice and legal counselling and raising public confidence in the judiciary 
for vulnerable groups, particularly poor and vulnerable women, refugees, survivors of gender based 
violence, children, youth, and people with disabilities;
..Including Syrian refugees in the national legal protection systems and expanding legal aid services 
to them, particularly to refugees who are survivors of SGBV and children in conflict with the law;
..Supporting centres and legal clinics in host communities by improving their resources and 
accessibility and establishing new centers where needed;
..Enhancing the capacities of Shari’a judges in host communities on gender and child-sensitive 
judicial processes; 
..Improving and streamlining judicial procedures and infrastructure of the Shari’a courts and 
supporting the implementation of reconciliation and mediation programs as well as rehabilitation 
and family counselling centres for family cases; 
..Supporting community mediation efforts, which can be implemented by civil society organizations 
for cases involving Syrian refugees and host community members;
..Enhancing legal awareness of the refugee population residing in host communities, particularly in 




relation to processes for obtaining civil documentation which will promote compliance with Jordanian 
law;
..Digitizing the operations related to the Family Card, which will allow clients to withdraw the 
adjudged amounts through ATMs without visiting the courts; 
..Building the capacity of implementing agencies in civil society and enhancing efforts for 
coordination, building coalitions, and increasing efficiency. 
..Supporting monitoring and evaluation efforts to improve data collection and reporting on access 
to justice in Jordan. 




2.3.7 LIVELIHOODS

In addition to the added strain on Jordanian social services, the Syria crisis has also exacerbated pre-existing 
structural challenges within the Jordanian labour market and economy. According to the World Bank, 14.4 
percent of Jordan’s population lives below the poverty line a third of the population is considered transient 
poor – an ever larger share given 70 percent population increase since 2004.62 The vast majority of Syrians 
in Jordan are highly vulnerable. While humanitarian assistance has buffered many urban and camp based 
refugees from extreme levels of food insecurity and vulnerability, negative coping mechanisms remain 
widespread, with a reported 26 percent of out-of-camp refugee households depending on the income 
generated by family members in socially degrading, exploitative, high risk or illegal temporary jobs in order 
to meet their basic food needs.63 

Through successive reforms, the government has consistently worked to address unemployment rates, 
which have hovered between 12-14 percent for the past decade. Unemployment has disproportionately 
affected women and youth. In 2016, rates for women were about twice that of men and as high as 30 
percent among youth aged 15 to 24.64 

IN ADDITION TO THE ADDED STRAIN ON JORDANIAN SOCIAL SERVICES, 
THE SYRIA CRISIS HAS ALSO EXACERBATED PRE-EXISTING STRUCTURAL 
CHALLENGES WITHIN THE JORDANIAN LABOUR MARKET AND ECONOMY. 

At the London Conference in February 2016, the Government of Jordan committed to creating 200,000 job 
opportunities and facilitate business development processes for Syrians over three years conditional upon 
increased support from the international community. These economic opportunities have the potential 
to allow refugees to sustainably meet their basic needs and contribute the broader Jordanian economy. 
Assistance to this end must recognize and equitably support poor Jordanians to be effective. 

Interventions Addressing Identified Needs and Vulnerabilities 

In the 2016-2018 Jordan Response Plan, the combined Livelihoods and Food Security Sector proposed 
interventions to support crisis-affected and vulnerable populations by promoting their livelihoods, food 
security, and income-generation capacity. The small number of interventions in Livelihoods in 2016 have 
focussed on strengthening resilience, providing emergency short-term employment and promoting skills 
exchange activities between Jordanian host community members and refugees. In terms of targeting 
refugees, the majority of investment has been made through volunteer and short-term work projects to 
inject much needed cash in to camp households and economies. 

In light of the livelihood-focused commitments made in the Jordan Compact, the scope for investment in 
livelihood has broadened considerably. Following the London conference, two notable agreements have 
been reached to generate employment and improve the investment climate in Jordan:

..A concessional financing facility by WBG to deliver development financing to Syrians refugees and 
affected host communities;
..An EU-Jordanian Trade agreement relaxing the existing rules of origin, thus allowing Jordanian 
companies easier access to the EU market. Eligible companies will be required to employ a share of 
Syrian refugees.
..Several additional pilot activities are being carried out with the purpose of bridging short-term

support with longer-term sustainable livelihoods, including:

..Supporting the Ministry of Labour and its directorates in processing work permit applications to 
facilitate achieving the agreed refugee employment targets. 
..Supporting agricultural cooperatives in submitting work permit applications for agricultural 
labourers, rather than through the standard employer contract modality, through ILO and MoL;
..Launching a pilot project aimed at matching women refugees with jobs in the garment sector; 
..Engaging cash for work and short-term employment activities in municipal waste management, 
land management and infrastructure projects.


Unmet Needs and Vulnerabilities 

Sector-level vulnerabilities remain numerous and information on the economic activities and profiles of 
Syrian refugees remain scarce. However, a study by the ILO/WANA institute on the skills available among 
the Syrians has demonstrated that there is a set of available skills which can quickly be integrated into the 
labour market. 

At the macro-level, real GDP is estimated to have contracted to 2.4 percent in 2015 from 3.1 percent in 
2014, and both small businesses and entire industries are suffering from the economic fallout of regional 
turmoil. Employers face numerous challenges when it comes to engaging qualified and unskilled labour 
in the Jordanian, migrant and refugee labour pools. Administrative quotas, financial and legal compliance 
issues, and vocational and technical skillset mismatches all limit labour absorption and production capacity 
in Jordan. 

A STUDY BY THE ILO/WANA INSTITUTE ON THE SKILLS AVAILABLE AMONG THE 
SYRIANS HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE IS A SET OF AVAILABLE SKILLS 
WHICH CAN QUICKLY BE INTEGRATED INTO THE LABOUR MARKET. 

At the individual level, social protection assistance is unable to keep pace with the growing needs of 
the population of concern. Additionally, cash and direct assistance alone is not a bridge to sustainable 
livelihoods and requires complementary support and opportunities to achieve. 

Each month, cash for work programming injects around 450,000 JOD into the Zaatari camp economy and 
provides work opportunities to 4,000-6,000 refugees.65 The newly established market places in Azraq camp 
require significant entrepreneurial support, improved supply chain access and increased cash circulation 
in order to accommodate the needs of some 21,000 new arrivals in 2016. Outside the camp, regular 
employment arrangements for Syrian refugees are rare, with 82 percent of employed 19-60 year olds 
reporting working in informal temporary roles.66 

Though some 34,000 Syrian refugees have acquired work permits and formal positions, around 1 percent of 
those are women.67 The majority of Syrian refugee women perceive childcare (62 percent) and household 
responsibilities (59 percent) as obstacles to women’s employment, and 94 percent of Syrian refugee women 
are out of the labour force — trends which are largely consistent with findings among poor Jordanian 
women.68

Finally, while micro and small businesses (MSEs) are the primary job growth engine in Jordan outside of 
the public sector, many face strong disincentives around the registration process. A large percentage of 
Jordanian and Syrian businesses remain in the informal realm, which is preventing them from growing, 
accessing financial services and expanding to achieve broad-based economic growth for the country.69 

Recommendations 

The Livelihoods sector has been minimally funded to date, leaving the economic and livelihoods 
development provisions of the Jordan Compact in particular need of investment and expansion in order to 
turn the Syrian refugee crisis into a development opportunity that attracts new investments and creating 
jobs for Jordanians and Syrian refugees.70 

Based on the implementation of the JRP 2016-2018, and in light of the growing needs and vulnerabilities, 
the following actions are recommended for the period 2017-2019 within the framework of existing rules 
and regulations:

1) Immediate livelihoods stabilization and short-term self-reliance support for both Jordanians and 
Syrians through: 

..Expanding short-term income opportunities and employment creation around camp and local 
infrastructure within a framework that is gender, age and disability sensitive, and that ensures 
sustainability within water, waste, energy, forestry and rangeland practices; 
..Promoting protection-oriented and dignified short-term employment for Syrian refugees in 
preparation for durable solutions;
..Targeted self-employment support to re-establish or jumpstart MSMEs for local entrepreneurs;
..Expanding refugees’ involvement in service provision in camps and host communities through 
cash for work.


2) Local economic recovery leading to sustainable livelihoods for Jordanians and Syrians through: 

..Taking advantage of and facilitating the implementation of the recent EU Commission decision to 
relax the rules of origin for enterprises which employ a share of Syrian labour in their production; 
..Implementing demand-driven short-term technical and vocational training and job placement 
with a focus on private sector engagement and women’s economic participation;
..Creating partnership with the private sector to match available skills, vocational training and higher 
education to current and existing job openings; 
..Promoting the growth of employment-generation community cooperatives, social entrepreneurship 
and tech-enabled activities;
..Improving access to job readiness, counselling and employment matching services benefitting 
refugee and host Jordanian job seekers;
..Providing refugees with skills recognition, equivalency and vocation certification;
..Expanding access to formal employment opportunities for Syrian refugee men and women 
meeting decent work and protection standards;
..Developing financial product and equity funds facilitating access to credit for excluded Syrian 
refugee and vulnerable Jordanian households;

..Accelerating business environment reforms;
..Improving rural and peri-urban income-generation and employment through smallholder crop 
and livestock production and integrated homestead farming, agro-processing and produce marketing. 


3) Long-term employment creation and inclusive economic growth through: 

..Encouraging private sector and small business development that includes more access to markets 
and to financial services;
..Improving policies on wage, labour migration management and decent work standards, with the 
objective of cultivating an environment that is conducive to investments; 
..Strengthening stakeholder capacities to shape strategy for local economic development including 
value chain development;
..Facilitating dialogue amongst municipalities, community-based organisations (CBOs) and the 
private sector in order to foster participatory local economic development, public-private partnerships, 
and social cohesion between and among Syrians and Jordanians.




2.3.8 LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND MUNICIPALITIES 

The continuous pressure on municipalities to deliver services has been affected by their already-limited 
capacity to address housing deficiencies, induce local economic development, and support social cohesion 
within communities. The sudden growth in population has contributed to the increase of local tensions, 
particularly from Jordanian citizens in host communities who are demanding a more effective response to 
their own needs from state institutions and local authorities. The four areas within the Municipalities Sector 
most affected by the Syria crisis are:

1) Municipal Service Delivery

..Providing municipalities with the machinery and equipment needed; 
..Implementing urgently required infrastructure projects, including road construction, street lighting 
and other public works;
..Constructing public areas, including parks, libraries, community and women centres, and sports 
and recreational facilities;
..Strengthening partnership with the private sector. 


2) Integrated Solid Waste Management (SWM)

Water, soil, and air pollution have increased following the Syria crisis due to the inability of municipalities to 
cope with increased waste, including illegal dumping and the inappropriate disposal and burning of solid 
waste. 

THE CONTINUOUS PRESSURE ON MUNICIPALITIES TO DELIVER SERVICES HAS 
BEEN AFFECTED BY THEIR ALREADY-LIMITED CAPACITY TO ADDRESS HOUSING 
DEFICIENCIES, INDUCE LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND SUPPORT SOCIAL 
COHESION WITHIN COMMUNITIES. 

The vulnerability index shows that the indicator relating to solid waste management compactors stands 
at 11 percent 71 — meaning that 11 percent of the population (Jordanians and Syrian refugees) receive 
inadequate services due to the lack of maintenance of and inefficient usage of compactors.72 The most 
extreme vulnerable sub-districts are Ain-Albasha in Amman, Qasabet Zarqa and Azraq in Zarqa, and 
Qasabet Madaba, Qasabet Jarash and Qasabet Irbid. Furthermore, the indicator measuring capacity of solid 
waste landfill, shows vulnerability at 20 percent,73 meaning that 20 percent of solid waste will not be land 
filled. Municipal solid waste (MSW) collection coverage is estimated at about 90 percent and 70 percent 
for urban and rural areas respectively. About 50 percent of MSW is food waste (organics), and 35 percent 
is packaging waste. Most of MSW ends up at dumpsites and landfills, whereas only 7 percent is currently 
recovered informally in Jordan. 

According to the recent Vulnerability Assessment Framework, the vast majority of Syrians in Jordan surveyed 
are severely vulnerable with regards to water and sanitation services. This is predominantly caused by solid 
waste management, where 80 percent of cases have experienced solid waste vector evidence more than 

71) Working compactors at each sub-district (supply) compared with total volume of solid waste produced per day (demand) based on the total

twice in the last year, and 20 percent of cases have experience wastewater overflows more than once in the 
last year.74 

The government of Jordan has finalized the solid waste management master plans for the municipalities of 
Irbid, Mafraq and Al-Ramtha were in line with the national strategy and with support from the Regional and 
Local Development Programme. The Ministry of Municipal Affairs (MOMA) and Ministry of Energy (MOE) 
have supported the development of a master plan to rehabilitate and expand the major dumpsite at Al-
Ekedir, and the Government of Jordan also launched the National Strategy for Solid Waste Management in 
February 2015. 75

3) Mainstreaming Social Cohesion and Civic Engagement 

Municipal services have been stretched by overpopulated host communities, leading to increasing social 
tensions. The influx of refugees has caused clear demographic changes that need to be continuously 
addressed through community engagement. Engagement with youth at the municipal level needs to be 
focused on potential community outreach in relation to peace and non-violence through municipalities.

 4) The Capacity of Municipal Administrations 

While MOMA is upgrading its systems for financial management and working towards developing regulatory 
frameworks for guiding municipalities, the ministry has insufficient capacity in terms of administrative and 
technical staff and financial management and accountable systems, in addition to lacking equipment and 
logistical means, leading to inefficient service delivery. Too often, management is concentrated in the hands 
of the Mayor, with insufficient checks and-balances by the Municipal Council. Municipalities frequently fail 
to meet local needs due to inadequate financial resources as well as limited technical capacity. A variety 
of approaches are needed in order to strengthen local revenue and generate revenues from a range of 
sources.

 5) Urban Management 

While the Syria crisis in Jordan is profoundly urban, there is no systematic analysis of needs and potential 
responses from an urban perspective. If basic planning does not take place and planned land is not made 
available, there is a risk that informal settlements sprawl outside the planning boundaries, which makes 
them harder to support and contain in the future. Municipalities are in need of appropriate mechanisms to 
support more effective decision-making, resource allocation and urban response by humanitarian actors, 
development actors and Governments targeting the most vulnerable communities. 

Interventions Addressing Identified Needs and Vulnerabilities 

The interventions conducted by partners and donors in the last year include:

..The Emergency Services and Social Resilience Project (ESSRP) aims at supporting Jordanian 
municipalities and host communities in addressing the immediate service delivery impact of Syrian 
refugee inflows in Northern Jordan. The ESSRP supported 9 municipalities in the governorates of Irbid 
and Mafraq, with total grants of 20 million.76 Since then, the project expanded to include a total of 
16 participating municipalities.77 The project spent another USD20 million during 2015 (total project 
funding is USD 57 million including USD 3 million from the government of Jordan;

77) Including Maan, Ajloun, Sahab, Zarqa and other municipalities outside Irbid and Mafraq



..A Mapping of Risks and Resources (MRR) was conducted in 16 municipalities,78,79 and a local 
development framework for 2015-2018 was produced as a result. The number of municipalities of the 
ESSRP were expanded and the community outreach programme was replicated in 27 municipalities 
in Northern Jordan; 
..The “Mitigating the impact of the Syrian refugee crisis on Jordanian vulnerable host communities” 
project provides direct support to 36 municipalities. Since 2014, fifteen public parks have been 
renovated and equipped with sufficient playgrounds, libraries, and other public services.80 Moreover, 
a Conflict-related Development Analysis (CDA) was conducted in 6 governorates, which included 
the formulation of intervention plans for each governorate.81 The analysis produced a community 
cohesion grant mechanism to support municipalities through civil society organizations to promote 
social cohesion. The estimated budget for implementing such initiative is USD 5.5 million for the 
period 2016-2018; 
..The MOMA capacity assessment report was conducted in 2016 to produce a comprehensive training 
plan and establish a training institute for local governance in Jordan nationwide. This is expected to be 
budgeted with an amount of USD 20 million through 2017-2022; 
..The Community Enhancement Program (CEP) is a five-year (2013-2018), USD 50 million project 
that builds community cohesion and enhances the resilience of communities to address evolving 
challenges more effectively. CEP is demand-driven, with communities identifying local priorities, 
including support for youth, women, refugees, and people with disabilities. CEP provides assistance 
to municipalities to better deliver services in the form of small-scale construction, such as for public 
spaces and road maintenance, and provision of equipment across several sectors; 
..CITIES is a five-year (2016-2021), USD 58.6 million program to support municipal and subnational 
governance. The program will enhance municipal service delivery, including solid waste management; 
institutional capacity, including financial and administrative; the enabling environment; citizen-
government engagement; and social cohesion and resilience;
..A Solid Waste Value Chain Analysis in Irbid and Mafraq was conducted, with the objective of 
providing robust data and information for the design and implementation of solid waste management 
interventions. An agreement of USD 15 million was signed to rehabilitate and construct an emergency 
landfill cell in order to expand the lifetime of Al-Ekedir.82 Additionally, 5 million USD will be covering 
the support program of waste pickers lively hood through 2016-2019. A USD 10.6 million intervention 
was implemented by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs with needed technical assistance to alleviate the 
pressure on solid waste collection and disposal in Irbid and Mafraq. 
..USD 3.2 million has been provided to support the municipalities of Mafraq, Irbid and Karak with 
improving the municipal waste collection during the period 2014-2017. An additional USD 17.1 
million was invested to support 20 municipalities with labour intensive collecting and processing of 
recyclable waste to reduce the environmental impact of waste in the refugee hosting communities, 
thus reducing conflict within the civil society. The supported municipalities are in the governorates of 
Irbid, Jerash, Balqa, Ajloun, Mafraq, Madaba, Karak, Amman and Zarqa. The labour intensive collecting 
and processing of recyclable waste will create around 9000 cash-for-work jobs for vulnerable 
Jordanians and Syrian refugees in the targeted host communities.
..The Municipality Support Programme, the first phase of which was launched in 2014 with a budget 
of USD 1.3 million and set to conclude in December 2016, aims at promoting resilience and social 
cohesion of the most vulnerable populations in Jordan through improving basic and social services

delivery, while empowering local communities at the socio-economic level. Moreover, the programme 
aims at developing the capacities of local authorities while providing effective tools to enable the 
development of medium-long term sustainable delivery solutions. An additional USD 1.3 million was 
budgeted for the second phase of the project, which is set to launch in December 2016. 

..A USD 106.2 million sector Policy Loan has been provided for use on a set of actions to be achieved 
in 2016 and 2017, targeting improvements in the municipal finance sector in three main areas: i) 
Strengthening national framework to improve municipal financial sustainability; ii) strengthening 
municipal financial management systems and capacities and iii) strengthening CVDB’s contribution 
to the financing of municipal development.


DESPITE THE GOVERNMENT’S ONGOING EFFORTS AND THE SUPPORT OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND DONORS, JORDAN’S MUNICIPALITIES NEED 
TO CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN THEIR CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO 
KEY SERVICE DELIVERY AND LOCAL DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES STEMMING 
FROM THE SYRIA CRISIS.

..Around USD 8.5 million has been provided to support 11 municipalities within Irbid and Mafraq 
governorates that have been impacted by the Syrian refugee crisis. This will entail projects aimed at 
enhancing municipal service delivery, such as opening roads and pavements, hot mixed asphalt and 
purchasing construction and cleaning equipment. 
..A three-year program was as launched in 2014 to enhance resilience capacities for a number of 
municipalities within Irbid and Mafraq governorates. The first phase of the program targeted five 
municipalities with a budget of USD 2.96 million, while the second phase extended support to 16 
municipalities with a budget of USD 5 million. Both the first and second phases focused on municipal 
service delivery, including such as opening roads and pavements, hot mixed asphalt and purchasing 
construction and cleaning equipment. The third phase of the program, with a budget of USD 11 
million, delivered support to 6 municipalities, allocating around 36 percent of funds to implement 
vocational zones to help improve local capacities, while the remaining funds were allocated for 
purchasing necessary equipment. 


Unmet Needs and Vulnerabilities 

..As the influx of refugees as somewhat decreased in 2016, the remaining needs in the Municipal 
Sector are similar to those stated in the 2016 JRP. However, thanks to all the effort by partners and 
the government, the projects will target the same areas where vulnerability persists albeit with much 
more focused responses. These include: 
..Delivery of Essential Municipal Services: Enhancing the efficiency of municipal administration 
and service delivery processes to improve overall equitable service delivery and investment for local 
development, in addition to supporting Joint Service Councils to fulfill their mandate as prescribed by 
the Municipalities Law. 
..Solid Waste Management (SWM): Ensuring that SWM programmes and projects include specific 
deliverables based on the National Solid Waste Management Strategy for the municipalities and the 
SWM Value Chain Analysis. 
..Social Cohesion and Civic Participation: Building on community outreach and engagement efforts 
by working with municipalities to plan and deliver municipal services in full engagement with local 
NGOs and community groups, in order to enhance social cohesion in tension areas and address the 
public participation and participatory approach. 




..Urban Management: Any future planning initiatives should address the immediate urban planning 
and management impact associated with the Syria crisis, utilized to facilitate the coordinated 
investment of resources in line with municipal plans and policies. There is a need for a systemic 
analysis of needs and potential responses through an urban information management system that is 
compatible and harmonious with the national and local systems being used to support more effective 
decision-making, resource allocation, and urban responses. 


Recommendations 

Despite the government’s ongoing efforts and the support of the international community and donors, 
Jordan’s municipalities need to continue to strengthen their capacity to be able to respond to key service 
delivery and local development priorities stemming from the Syria crisis. The recommendations provided 
below target host communities mainly in the affected municipalities in line with the JRP and with ongoing 
programmes. 

..Supporting interventions that target urgently required investment and capacity building in 
municipal services and infrastructure, with a particular focus on SWM. 
..Addressing immediate capacity development requirements related to the SWM cycle for JSCs and 
other municipal service lines (e.g. road maintenance and development, street lighting, small/storm 
water and sewage maintenance works, parks, public spaces, and maintenance of cultural facilities), to 
promote local social entrepreneurship addressing the gaps and needed services. 
..Building resilience through interventions that will support the creation of an enabling environment 
for local public sector performance improvement. For example, technical assistance to municipalities 
in affected areas targeting organizational development, financial management, and fiscal autonomy. 
..Assessing the situation of most indebted municipalities to determine the drivers of debt and 
improve their financial sustainability and debt management, in addition to ensuring that significant 
efforts are put to support concerned Joint Service Councils to fulfill their mandate.
..Monitoring and analyzing the absorptive capacity of different municipalities and planning 
settlement growth. 
..Providing rapid planning and coordination support to municipalities and communities in affected 
areas, in addition to supporting municipalities in the development of urban information management 
systems to support more effective decision-making, resource allocation and urban response by 
humanitarian actors, development actors and governments. 
..Subsequent inputs targeting recovering should capitalize on, improve or initiate new community 
and city-level plans that are responsive to the needs of the population, focusing on poor and vulnerable 
groups and the developmental challenges imposed by the influx of Syrian refugees into municipalities.
..Providing technical assistance to strengthen capacity in governorate and municipal Local 
Development Units (LDUs), with a particular focus on proactive planning and implementation that 
can capture pressing local needs. With regard to sustaining local development, Local Recovery and 
Development plans should be supported using a value chain and Municipal Needs and Response 
analysis methodology focusing on equal participation, reliable sex disaggregated data, and good 
practices.
..Providing MOMA with support to define a set of municipal service standards, identify local 
governance capacity building needs, and assess progress under the system of Governorate 
Development Plans.




2.3.9 SHELTER

The Syria crisis is severely straining the absorptive capacity of the Jordanian housing market due to 
the spiraling demand for housing. In 2016, the overall housing market gap exceeded 100,000 housing 
units, representing a significant increase from the estimated annual average need by Jordanians. More 
importantly, pre-crisis supply was not well aligned with demand, with an oversupply at the middle and 
upper end of the market. The price range of new housing units has been between JD 30,000 and JD 60,000 
making them unaffordable to low- and lower-middle income groups.83 Inflation in the cost of rent has put 
Jordanian and poor Syrian families outside the camps out of the market. In Mafraq, price of monthly rent 
has increased from 70 – 150 JOD before the crisis to 200 – 300 JOD at present.84 

There are no entry-level housing options for lower middle income Jordanians, and rental housing is 
increasingly less affordable for lower income Jordanian and Syrian families. Since the onset of the crisis, the 
consequences of the inadequate supply of affordable residential units has led to increasing rental prices, 
sub-division of existing units, conversion of outbuildings into rental accommodation, and some limited 
construction by individuals. There has not been a scaled response either from the private sector or the 
government.85 

According to UNHCR’s 2015 urban household survey, rental payments remain the main refugees concern 
and the highest expenditure for most of them,86 averaging a whopping 50 percent of refugee household’s 
monthly expenditures; compared to an average of 20 percent for Jordanians.87 The search for adequate 
and affordable housing followed by livelihoods have been the two primary causes of tension between 
Syrians and Jordanians.88 

In 2016, 29 percent of out of camps Syrian refugees have moved at least once in the previous six months.89 
Moreover, almost half of Syrian refugees have been on the move in the preceding year, reflecting the 
difficulties they often must face in order to secure stable accommodation. In urban areas, 25 percent of 
Syrians are severely shelter vulnerable and 50 percent are highly shelter vulnerable.90 An estimated 10 
percent of Syrian refugees are under immediate threat of eviction.91 More than 87 percent of Syrian refugees 
outside of camps are in debt.92 One in five Syrian refugee families in host communities does not have any 
form of rental contract, which is not only a legal requirement for all non-Jordanians but also elementary 
protection from eviction and a precondition for registration with the MOI.93 

Syrian refugees are often forced to live in substandard and overcrowded accommodation, thus increasing 
their vulnerability. 28 percent of Syrian refugees are living in substandard shelters, including 8 percent 
living within informal settlements. Out of the total refugee caseload in urban areas, 14 percent are living in 
one room and 12 percent are in houses with more than 4 individuals per room. 

The entire out of camp refugee caseload includes 20 percent in accommodations that do not provide basic 
protection from the elements and 28 percent have leaking roofs, damp or moldy buildings. In addition to 
the threats of evictions and protection, substandard housing also affects the health of the residents who 
risk contracting respiratory infections, asthma, and other ailments.94

Interventions Addressing Identified Needs and Vulnerabilities

A combination of interventions supporting both refugee and host communities has been implemented 
since the onset of the refugee crisis It includes interventions such as (1) targeted cash for rent for extremely 
vulnerable Syrian refugees and Jordanians, (2) supporting the increase in the number of housing units 
through the completion of unfinished housing units and (3) upgrading substandard housing units in 
urban and rural areas. 

Furthermore, the first phase of the Jordan Affordable Housing Program (a private sector funded solution to 
provide affordable housing for lower-middle income Jordanians as owners and vulnerable Syrian refugees 
and Jordanian families as renters) has been implemented. An extensive housing demand survey was 
undertaken in eight governorates, in addition to an in-depth analysis of the financial sector in Jordan that has 
confirmed the ability and capacity to provide suitable financing. An agreement was reached to participate 
in the JAH programme from eleven financial institutions in Jordan and pre-qualified letters were issued 
to qualified citizens. A national design competition was launched with the Jordan Engineers Association 
to design housing that is innovative and locally suitable. The construction of 14 Demonstration units in 
four different locations through the Jordan Construction Contractors Association has been completed. 
Following the successful initiation of the first pilot project in Ramtha, around 900 citizens indicated their 
interest in participating in the program. 

Since its establishment in 2012, over 400,000 refugees have passed through the refugee camp of Za’atari. 
Currently, the camp is accommodating around 80,000 refugees (13,500 HH), residing in 12 districts. The 
majority of refugees relocated within host communities across Jordan, while some voluntarily returned to 
Syria.

The mobile nature of the refugee population in/out of the camp, coupled with continued new arrivals up 
to April 2014 when Azraq Camp was established, disrupted infrastructural planning and assistance delivery 
as refugees tended to change their locations within the camp very frequently. In order to improve the 
camp infrastructure and upgrade refugee shelters, the grid system of Za’atari on the masterplan has been 
maintained, creating blocks and streets to clarify the skeleton and land use, facilitating communication 
within the community by creating a community structure. The restructuring plan for all settlements within 
the camp has been implemented this year, prior to the ongoing infrastructure projects such as wastewater, 
water supply, and road and electricity networks. The result of the project includes the implementation of 
an address system for every household and mapping their boundaries on the masterplan.95 

Za’atari Refugee Camp:

..2,343 emergency shelters (tents) provided;
..2,738 semi-permanent shelters (pre-fabricated caravans) installed;
..683 (new design) prefabricated caravans installed;
..1,583 households relocated under the ongoing restructuring exercise of the camp.


In April 2014, the second largest site, Azraq Camp, was opened with an initial capacity of some 54,000 
individuals. Four villages (Village II, III, V, VI) have been constructed with concrete flooring added to the 
transitional-shelters (caravans). Two market areas with various community facilities were established. 
The existing villages can be extended to accommodate an additional 13,000 to 15,000 refugees and the 
construction of additional villages is also possible should the need arise. 

Azraq Refugee Camp:

..5,710 of existing shelters and associated facilities upgraded

..815 transitional shelters (T-Shelters) constructed
..9,735 existing T-shelters improved through the provision of concrete flooring
..2,068 existing T-shelters improved through maintenance works
..7,613,116 m² of site developed in accordance with final designs
..60m bridge, connecting villages three and six, constructed
..1,640 m of drainage culverts installed

..224 m² of shades installed
..2,500 m² of sealcoat roads
..200m of fences


Unet Needs and Vulnerabilities 

There is still a wide gap between demand and supply in the housing sector that requires an accelerated 
response by the public and private sectors to provide additional affordable housing units for both 
vulnerable Jordanians and Syrian refugees. To complement humanitarian and development interventions, 
a housing profiling is needed to aid in updating the housing strategy. A program of legal, institutional and 
policy reform is also required to address some of the long-term structural challenges in the housing sector. 
This new strategy will concretely demonstrate how humanitarian and development issues can be linked 
within a specific sector.

THERE IS STILL A WIDE GAP BETWEEN DEMAND AND SUPPLY IN THE HOUSING 
SECTOR THAT REQUIRES AN ACCELERATED RESPONSE BY THE PUBLIC AND 
PRIVATE SECTORS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS FOR 
BOTH VULNERABLE JORDANIANS AND SYRIAN REFUGEES.

In urban areas, the lack of adequate housing, coupled with insecurity of tenure and high rental costs, has 
forced the majority of Syrian refugees to live in substandard accommodation. There is a need to continue 
upgrading such substandard accommodation and protect their rights when many Syrian refugees are living 
in rented accommodation, lacking basic security of tenure and are at risk of eviction. Despite pressing and 
obvious shelter needs in urban areas, not many agencies are able to provide tangible assistance. In 2015, 
the sector comprised 12 actors, which has dropped to 6 appealing partners in 2016. The lack of a targeted 
campaign advocating for funds has resulted with the Shelter Sector appeal to receive only 18 percent of its 
funding requirements for host community programming.

Furthermore, in both camp and urban/rural settings, it is vital to continue addressing the needs of WGBM 
and people with specific needs (such as those with disabilities, female headed households and the elderly), 
taking into consideration cultural sensitivities such as privacy, family linkages and origins.

Recommendations 

..Resilience-based interventions, such as the program for affordable housing to boost supply for 
affordable housing units in the mostly affected governorates (including but not limited to Irbid 
and Mafraq), and the Jordan Housing profiling program are designed to complement expected 
humanitarian shelter programming;




..It is also recommended to invest in infrastructure upgrades in existing villages and districts in Azraq 
and Zaatari. In Azraq; 
..In urban areas, recommendations include upgrading housing in poor condition and completing 
unfinished buildings with the intent of providing adequate and secure shelter for Syrian refugees and 
vulnerable Jordanians, while also supporting Jordanian landlords;
..Providing targeted conditional cash for rent to extremely vulnerable Syrian refugees in urban areas;
..Raising awareness on lease and rental laws targeting both Syrian refugees and Jordanian landlords;
..Encouraging resilience and innovation by integrating energy and water saving measures into the 
shelter response, such as solar panels, passive cooling systems and tap fillings;




2.3.10 SOCIAL PROTECTION 

Compounding financial crises, political turmoil in the region, and the Syria crisis have had a serious impact 
on the Jordanian economy. Pervasive unemployment remains a critical problem for the country; over 
the last three years, unemployment has averaged 12.6 percent. The absolute poverty rate for Jordanian 
families was 14.4 percent in 2010,96 meaning that 118,995 households were experiencing income poverty. 
Amongst the Jordanian population, women and children bear the brunt of poverty.97 

Key protection challenges for Jordanians include: (i) Poverty and unemployment, especially among 
women and youth; (ii) violence against children; (iii) sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), particularly 
for women and girls; (iv) social security; (v) youth engagement; (vi) access to services for persons with 
disabilities and reduced mobility; and (vi) tensions within communities and risk of radicalisation. 

The overall situation for Syrian refugees in Jordan has become more difficult due to difficulties in formalizing 
their residency in non-camp settings, challenges in obtaining legal work opportunities and providing for 
their own basic needs, and a decline of humanitarian assistance. 

Key protection challenges for refugees include: (i) child labour; (ii) access to international protection in a 
timely manner; (iii) documentation and registration issues; (iv) sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), 
particularly for women and girls, including Conflict Related Sexual Violence (CRSV); (v) violence against 
children; (vi) access to services for persons with disabilities and reduced mobility; (vii) tensions with host 
communities; and (viii) access to sustainable livelihoods, particularly for women and youth. 

Interventions Addressing Identified Needs and Vulnerabilities

The JRP social protection response plan aims to provide vulnerable groups affected by the crisis with access 
to improved social protection and improved legal and operational protection frameworks and services in 
governorates most affected by the Syria crisis. 

THE OVERALL SITUATION FOR SYRIAN REFUGEES IN JORDAN HAS BECOME 
MORE DIFFICULT DUE TO DIFFICULTIES IN FORMALIZING THEIR RESIDENCY 
IN NON-CAMP SETTINGS, CHALLENGES IN OBTAINING LEGAL WORK 
OPPORTUNITIES AND PROVIDING FOR THEIR OWN BASIC NEEDS, AND A 
DECLINE OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE. 

Expanding social protection: Refugee protection interventions address identified priorities in terms of 
registration and civil status documentation, provision of rehabilitation sessions and/or assistive devices, 
provision of information on services and referral pathways, third country resettlement, and multi-sectoral 
services for survivors of SGBV and for children at risk, including unaccompanied and separated children. 

Partnerships between the government of Jordan, UN agencies and civil society organizations (CSOs) 
in support of safe spaces for victims of violence have strengthened multi-sectoral response services. 
To strengthen national capacity, investments have targeted national institutions providing services to 
survivors of violence. Support is also provided to Jordan’s reporting and adherence to the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women. 

96) Calculated as the level beneath which the minimal requirements for survival (i.e. minimum calorific requirement plus essential non-food items) 
are unmet. The absolute poverty line is equal to an expenditure of 814 JD per individual per year (or 67.8 JD per individual per month). At the 
household level this equates to 4395.6 JD per household per year (or 366.3 JD per household per month).

97) According to Jordan Poverty Reduction Strategy (2013).



Expanding Social Assistance: Refugee response agencies are able to assist 30 percent of the non-camp 
refugee population registered by UNHCR as of June 2016. This stands in stark contrast to the overall 
vulnerability as described by the Vulnerability Assessment Framework (VAF) baseline, which states that 
over 89 percent of the registered refugee population lives below the Jordanian poverty line and is unable 
to meet their basic needs. In both Azraq and Za’atari camps, basic needs for new arrivals were fully covered. 

While cash assistance support to Jordanians continues, a major segment of the poor, especially those 
pursuing work, are not being reached and the leakage of resources to the non-poor is substantial. As a 
result, the demand for social care services remains largely unmet. In response, the NAF established a new 
poverty focused criteria in 2012 with a range of new indicators to ensure transparency and inclusiveness. 

Unmet Needs and Vulnerabilities

National protection services, previously under-resourced, have been put under further strain as a result of 
the increased population in Jordan. So, there is a need to strengthen gender sensitive and child friendly 
protection system that addresses violence against women and children in Jordan; early marriages and child 
labour. There is also a need to improve and expand services to persons with disabilities, children without 
parental care, families from marginalized communities and children living and/or working on the streets. 

THE PRIMARY NEED IS TO SUPPORT THE CAPACITY OF REFUGEES AND 
THEREBY REDUCE DEPENDENCE ON NEGATIVE COPING MECHANISMS 
IN URBAN AREAS. 

Among Jordanian workers, work opportunities that cover rising costs of living are accessible to a small 
percentage of the workforce. In addition, social security remains beyond the reach of the majority of 
those informally employed, who constitute more than 40 percent of the work force. The working poor are 
ineligible to NAF Assistance. There is a need to scale up social insurance and protection schemes, while 
ensuring better cash transfers to the working poor and those living below the poverty line. 

The primary need is to support the capacity of refugees and thereby reduce dependence on negative 
coping mechanisms in urban areas. This remains to be achieved through unconditional cash grants for 
vulnerable refugee households in urban areas. In camps, there is a need to ensure investment in NFIs for new 
arrivals and replenishments and in the infrastructure required for their distribution, whilst striving for more 
cost-effective alternatives to the current distribution infrastructure. Programmes need to be expanded to 
provide community-based, multi-sector and case management services to survivors of SGBV and children 
at risk (including children at risk of recruitment by radical groups) to ensure the social protection needs of 
all are fully met. 

These programmes should focus on individuals with specific needs and vulnerabilities, such as people with 
disabilities; providing mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) services for children and community 
and family support for these children’s caregivers; and programmes for those with neurodevelopment 
disorders (including Autism, ADHD and intellectual disabilities).

In the face of reduced assistance, there is a need to bolster community based initiatives that promote 
positive coping mechanisms and the ability of Syrians to support their families. Additional focus needs to 
be placed on programmes that target youth and reduce reliance on child labour, early marriage and other 
negative coping mechanisms. Meanwhile, access to services and awareness of rights and entitlements 
need to be supported through counselling and awareness activities, including those related to personal 
status, civil documentation, and housing issues.



Recommendations

The Social Protection response should continue to implement activities identified as priorities for 2017. The 
interventions should prioritize the most vulnerable (persons with disabilities, persons with particular legal 
and protection needs, and the socio-economically vulnerable).

Efforts should focus on strengthening national systems while avoiding the creation of parallel systems for 
refugees whenever possible. This will require increased support for national protection service institutions 
such as SRAD/MOI, the Family Protection Department, Juvenile Police Department, Counter-Trafficking 
Unit, National Council for Family Affairs, Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Social Development.

Enhancing linkages between humanitarian and national violence tracking referral systems and standard 
operating procedures are of primary importance. Strengthened early identification, referral and 
comprehensive multi-sector response to SGBV and child protection cases remain a priority. This should 
include early and comprehensive clinical management of rape, mental health and psychosocial support 
(MHPSS); protection and other legal services; in addition to material assistance and the provision of 
programmes to promote self-reliance and positive coping mechanisms.

Support for integrated programmes that promote strong linkages between child protection and education 
is required. Social protection efforts shall coordinate with other sectors to strengthen self-reliance 
programmes and community-based initiatives. Refugees should be supported to meet basic needs, while 
phasing this gradually into a broader social protection logic, which allows refugees to develop and maintain 
their own assets. It is also essential to strengthen the participation of youth in their communities and other 
decisions that affect them with a focus on conflict resolution, employment skills, and promoting peaceful 
engagement.



2.3.11 TRANSPORT

The transport sector plays a key role in Jordan’s economy and contributes to over 8.1 % of the gross domestic 
product (GDP). It is growing at an annual rate of 6 % and employs nearly 7 % of the Jordanian labour force. 
The transport sector, as in other sectors, faces a number of challenges that have been further aggravated by 
the Syria crisis, which demands that the sector keep up with escalated needs while continuing to support 
the growth of Jordan’s economy. 

Existing roads in governorates mostly affected by the inflow of Syrian refugees (Irbid, Mafraq and Zarqa 
governorates) are in desperate need of expansion and urgent maintenance. The influx of Syrian refugees 
has increased the number of users of the road networks, personnel traffic, as well as heavy-loaded cargo, 
water supply, and sludge disposal trucks, which has led to a quicker than expected degradation of the 
existing road network. Furthermore, the crisis has resulted in enlarging the financial burden on vulnerable 
inhabitants and exhausted institutions. As a result, social tensions in host communities are on the rise due 
to increased pressure on public transport and roads networks which are used by inhabitants on their way 
to schools, health centers, work and other daily activities.

EXISTING ROADS IN GOVERNORATES MOSTLY AFFECTED BY THE INFLOW OF 
SYRIAN REFUGEES ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF EXPANSION AND URGENT 
MAINTENANCE. 

Another challenge is that Jordan has lost one of its major trade routes, and the escalating violence in Syria 
has forced the Kingdom to develop alternative routes mainly through Aqaba Port, resulting in additional 
burdens on existing infrastructure 

Interventions Addressing Identified Needs and Vulnerabilities 

The transport sector interventions of providing public transportation, stations services and roads networks 
are pivotal and essential for other sectors and cross cut with all the services provided within these sectors; 
mainly education, livelihood and health services. As of 31 August, 2016 , the transport sector did not 
receive any funding to support its proposed interventions in the JRP 2016-2018.

The following interventions have been proposed by the Government but remain underfunded:

..The Ministry of Transport (MOT) launched its Long Term National Strategy, which aims to create a 
clear framework for the next 20 years. Some key aspects of this plan included developing a modern 
railway network that interconnected neighboring countries; reinforcement of Aqaba port as the main 
gateway of the country; setting integrated and complementary measures to increase the quality 
attractiveness of public transport. As of September 2016, several gains have been made within each 
of these objectives, including: 
––Finalizing the feasibility study for Amman – Zarqa bus rapid transport system (BRT), the 
construction is expected to commence in early 2017.
––Implementing the Queen Alia Airport expansion and rehabilitation project.
–– Integrating the national strategy into Jordan Vision 2025, which was launched in May 2015.



..The necessary funding for connecting Amman and Zarqa via public transportation was provided 
by external grants, and the cost of the project was estimated to be US$ 154 million. 




..The Ministry of Public Works (MOPW) has started a US$ 10 million project to construct several 
access roads in the northern borders, which is both highly needed and critically underfunded.


Unmet Needs and Vulnerabilities 

The identified needs and vulnerabilities of the transport sector under the JRP 2016-2018 remain unchanged 
due to the lack of funding. The following main priorities need to be addressed in the coming three years 
(2017-2019):

..There is a pressing need to initiate plans to build a more efficient and enhanced public transport 
system to accommodate the increase in population due to the Syria crisis. It is also important to 
address the needs to expand, maintain, and upgrade existing infrastructure of the road networks and 
road safety in Irbid, Zarqa, and Mafraq governorates, including access points to the borders before 
additional damage makes it necessary to entirely replace roads.
..There is also a need to upgrade the modes of transportation in Jordan, particularly in regions mostly 
affected by Syrian refugees, and to enable MOT and MPWH to undertake evidence-based responses to 
provide improved transport services to Syrian refugees and host communities.
..In order to improve service delivery and resilience, it is essential to integrate the needs of the 
transport sector with other essential services, such as water and sanitation, education, health, and 
security. There is also a pressing need for interventions such as access roads and public transport 
services for newly constructed schools and health centers as well as services needed to expand 
transport services to refugees residing in the host communities.


Recommendations 

Competing needs resulting from the Syria crisis currently manifest the scarce availability of financial 
resources, with limited allocations towards municipality construction efforts. Financing mechanisms must 
ensure resource availability to prioritize construction of new roads and maintenance of existing ones. 

The influx of Syrian refugees to Jordan requires well awareness of the issues surrounding traffic congestion, 
and commitment to implementing strategies to improve the public transport system, in cooperation with 
the private sector, and in a manner that will provide high social, economic, and environmental returns. This 
should include upgrading and improving road safety standards; maintenance of existing roads networks; 
rehabilitation and expansion; and expansion of development and regional roads with social, economic, 
and environmental returns. 

The preparation of a road master plan that includes the modernization of traffic flows and possible 
enlargement of city streets is needed. This plan should additionally consider more efficient and reliable 
public transport services that appropriately balances public and private transport, as well as modes of 
transport (rail or road), and makes the buses more reliable in an effort to divert part of the traffic done by 
private cars. A comprehensive plan will minimize the overall transport costs including direct operating 
costs of the rolling stocks, infrastructure, time, security, and comfort, as well as indirect costs such as noise, 
pollution, and accidents.



2.3.12 WASH

An area or a region is experiencing water stress when annual water supplies drop below 1,700 m3 per 
person. When annual water supplies drop below 1,000 m3 per person, the population faces water scarcity, 
and below 500 cubic meters “absolute scarcity.”98 With annual renewable resources of less than 100 cubic 
meter per capita, Jordan is more than 90 percent below the water scarcity threshold.99 

The current level of water supply delivered to the population, on average, is about 60 liters/capita/day.100 
In 2014, water demand has increased sharply by 21 percent across Jordan and 40 percent in the northern 
governorates. The Ministry of Water and Irrigation, together with sector partners and donors, have been 
actively working toward utilizing resources to address the critical needs emanating from the Syria crisis, 
in addition to the ongoing efforts to realize the objectives of the National Strategy 2016-2025 and SDG 
targets.

Interventions Addressing Identified Needs and Vulnerabilities 

Key implementing partners, including various UN agencies and NGOs, will continue providing WASH 
services in Syrian refugee camps. All targeted activities will achieve the following:

..Equal and adequate provision of services to meet the minimum standards: self-sufficient water 
systems where preferably most of the water comes from internal drilled boreholes;
..Sustainability: connecting village storage reservoirs to water sources in Azraq; and construction of 
water and sewer networks in Zaatari 
..Cost-effectiveness: construction of onsite wastewater treatment plants in Zaatari and Azraq, in 
addition to reuse schemes.


In host communities, different WASH interventions addressing vulnerable Jordanians and Syrians have been 
implemented to improve access to adequate water and safe sanitation by drilling and rehabilitating wells, 
reinforcing water networks, and expanding sewerage systems. Appropriate hygiene tools and education 
were introduced to households, schools and communities in villages, sub-districts and districts with severe 
and high priority, according to the established vulnerability criteria.

WITH ANNUAL RENEWABLE RESOURCES OF LESS THAN 100 CUBIC 
METER PER CAPITA, JORDAN IS MORE THAN 90 PERCENT BELOW THE 
WATER SCARCITY THRESHOLD.

The Ministry of Water and Irrigation has adopted a water vulnerability map which was developed in 2014 
to highlight municipalities with priority for providing water services according to multi-indicator criteria, 
Indicators for this purpose were selected as: percentage of Syrian refugees within specific host communities; 
the rate of poverty within each host community; and the planned versus actual water consumption within 
the community. 

Similarly, a sanitation vulnerability map was developed in mid-2015 which comprises three maps:

..Risk associated with wastewater treatment plants (whether or not a plant has reached hydraulic 
and biological capacity);
..Priority levels for areas currently served by sewer networks, based on the age of existing networks; 


98) http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/scarcity.shtml

99) National Water Strategy 2016-2025

100) ibid.



..Priority levels of areas that are not currently served by sewer networks, based on the risk associated 
with protection zones of water basins.


Plans and projects are underway to address gaps and needs that have been identified based on vulnerability 
assessments and the objectives of the National Water Strategy 2016-2025. While some of these projects 
require more than three or four years to be completed, they are nonetheless following a phased approach 
and will deliver measurable benefits to many people at the end of each phase. 

Donor investment is observed more in medium and large-scale projects, but not in quick impact projects 
such as borehole development, repair works of network, rehabilitation of pump stations, unblocking of 
sewers or manhole maintenance, although such projects are directly linked to the day-to-day needs of 
both Jordanians and Syrians. The Ministry of Water and Irrigation will continue to implement projects to:

..Increase the amount of water supply; 
..Reduce water losses, improve the efficiency of water and wastewater systems and energy efficiency;
..Expand sewerage coverage and enhance the capacity of wastewater treatment plants and quality 
of effluent water;
..Maximize utility performance to improve service delivery and cut down operational costs. 


Unmet Needs and Vulnerabilities 

In camps, the running cost to provide and sustain WASH services in Zaatari and Azraq is estimated at USD 
2.42 million per month. This cost is necessary to provide a comprehensive range of services, including 
water supply, wastewater collection, and solid waste services to minimise the impact of refugees on 
the surrounding environment. The running cost of water and wastewater treatment will decrease once 
sustainable infrastructure of water and sewer networks are constructed. Additionally, a monthly fund of 
USD 1.4 million is required for providing water and hygiene materials to more than 77,000 vulnerable 
Syrians in East and Northeast Badiya.

The costs for WAJ to provide water to Syrians in host communities amount to USD 4.36 million per month, 
with only a proportion of this covered by revenues. Although included as a project in the JRP, no funding 
has so far been secured to cover the additional O&M costs. 

Knowing that 89 percent of Syrian refugees live in host communities, extensive interventions are 
needed to respond to the needs particularly in severe and high vulnerable sub-districts. Reinforcement 
of water networks, storage and connections, latrine and sanitation systems in households, schools and 
health facilities as well as upgrading water systems including borehole rehabilitation and development, 
replacement of pumps are required to sustain water supply and improve service delivery in vulnerable 
districts.

Sanitation remains to be a challenge, with 63 percent of the households served with sewer network. Given 
the impact of the additional Syrian refugee population, there is an urgent need to improve wastewater safe 
disposal and to construct new sewer networks to increase coverage, in addition to bolstering the capacity 
of treatment plants — all of which will help reduce risks to the environment and public health. 

Funding remains a concern for both MWI and implementing agencies, particularly with regards to quick 
impact interventions and the optimization of operation and maintenance costs. Consistent and long-term 
funding will guarantee safe and reliable water supply by utility companies and will reduce health and 
security risks.



Recommendations 

Given the aforementioned data, our recommendations are as follows: 

..Maintaining continuous and regular funding of the recurrent cost of WASH services in the camps to 
sustain service delivery based on minimum standards;
..Improving access to water and sanitation facilities in households, schools, public health and 
community centres for vulnerable Jordanians and Syrians equally;
..Strengthening and improving water and wastewater infrastructure to enhance service delivery;
..Bridging the gap between water demand and supply through;
––Protecting and development of existing water sources;
––Using innovative water sources such as desalination, deep aquifers and wastewater reuse; 
––Increasing the storage capacity of dams and reservoirs and promoting rainwater harvesting



..Developing and strengthening sector policies, strategies and legislations, and sector reform, in 
order to improve performance and achieve equality and optimum resource utilization;
..Enhancing cost recovery and revenue collection, in addition to improving sector management and 
ensuring capacity building and efficient performance; 
..Using renewable energy to increase cost effectiveness;
..Improving sector performance to achieve SDG goals;
..Strengthening public private partnership and increasing community involvement and awareness 
to protect water resources and control consumption.101

3.1 INTRODUCTION 

This chapter presents all twelve combined refugee and resilience sector response plans as prepared by the 
respective task forces in a series of intensive working sessions and consultations. The result of TFs’ work has 
then been scrutinized by MOPIC, which has finalized each sector response in agreement with the relevant 
line ministry according to various criteria.

Therefore, while the following sector responses are based on the needs and vulnerabilities as highlighted 
in Chapter 2, they only include the interventions that are a priority for the Government of Jordan.

3.2 SECTOR RESPONSE PLANS 

3.2.1 EDUCATION

The Syria crisis continues to have a profound impact on Jordan’s education sector, and in particular on 
public schooling. During the school year 2015/2016, there were 236,304 school-aged Syrian boys and girls 
registered as refugees,102 145,458 of whom were enrolled in public schools in camps and host communities.103 
This represents a 12 percent increase in Syrian refugee students enrolled in schools compared to the 
2014/2015 school year.104 The number of students for the school year 2016/2017 is around 170,000 
students, which represents an increase of 16 percent, thereby exerting acute pressure on the resources 
and infrastructure of the education sector. Space in schools and the availability of trained teachers are 
major problems, particularly in the governorates of Amman, Irbid, Mafraq and Zarqa.105 In order to mitigate 
these challenges, the Ministry of Education (MoE) has had to recruit additional teachers who often lack of 
sufficient preparation and experience to manage challenging classroom environments. Almost half (47 
percent) of schools are now crowded, compared to 36 percent in 2012/2013.106 MoE continues to maintain 
double-shift schedules in 98 public schools, but is increasingly concerned that this is reducing the quality of 
education for all children, and especially for Jordanians. As a result, the ministry has introduced a modified 
double schedule as of the 2016/2017 year, with an additional 102 schools. Uneven access to education has 
consistently been highlighted as a cause of tension between Syrians and Jordanians,107 and violence and 
bullying has also been identified as a factor that has the potential to undermine the quality of education.108 
Jordan is committed to ensuring access to education to all Syrian refugee children but requires strategic 
support to safeguard the progress achieved under the Education Reform for a Knowledge Economy (ERfKE) 
process.109 

102) School-aged children (boys and girls) estimated to be 36 percent of total registered refugee population in Jordan, including 111,658 boys 
and 114, 822 girls. Youth aged 18-24 comprise 13 percent of the Syrian refugee population with 80,471 people (39,025 male and 41,446 female).

CHAPTER THREE

SECTOR RESPONSE PLANS



Syrians, particularly in camps, are performing well below their Jordanian counterparts.110 Low quality of 
education has lasting implications, particularly as students’ progress through school without mastering 
important foundational skills. An increasing concern is the low number of Syrian students that undergo 
and pass the Tawjihi (Jordan’s general secondary examination). In the 2015/2016 academic year, 1,605 out 
of 2,761 eligible Syrian refugee students sat the exam and only 536 (33.4 percent) succeeded. Low Tawjihi 
pass rates, coupled with high fees and documentation requirements to access post basic and higher 
education and training opportunities, has contributed to few youth having the chance to continue their 
education. 

Five years into the crisis, around 91,000 Syrian refugee children are out of formal education.111 Many refugee 
households, particularly in northern and eastern regions, cannot cover the cost of transportation and 
education material (stationery and clothing), or increasingly depend on their children to generate income 
to meet basic household needs. This deterioration is further aggravated by reductions in humanitarian 
assistance provided by international organizations.112 In Za’atari and Azraq, 89 percent of youth aged 19-
24 are not engaged in any kind of education or training opportunities.113 With new arrivals in Azraq, some 
16,000 children are in need of education services by the start of the new 2016/2017 school year. 

2016 Achievements 

In the school year 2016/2017, an additional 24,542 Syrian boys and girls were enrolled in formal education, 
bringing enrolment up to 170,000 students. 

1) Strengthened Education policy, planning and management: 

..3,265 teachers employed in double–shift schools and camps and an additional 2,459 teachers in 
single shift schools and their salaries are supported;
..MOE has initiated the NFE Catch up program for children of younger ages (9-12), targeting 25,000 
children;
..OPENEMIS has been launched and operational for 2016/2017 scholastic year;
..MOE has developed a selection criteria for teachers based on a competitive exam that will be 
adopted for the year 2016/2017.


2) Delivery of Quality Inclusive Education Services:

..Remedial education has reached more than 50,000 children and youth in host communities and 
camps;
..3,255 teachers have been trained to teach the new curriculum and in the areas of pre-service, 
leadership, counselling, and others;
..521 counsellors have been provided with orientation on psychosocial activities in public schools;
..A more holistic approach has been applied in the delivery of informal education to include basic 
learning, life skills and psychosocial support activities.

3) Access to Education Opportunities: 

..Continued free access to education to Syrian children in camps and host communities for 145,458 
students; 
..Learning space has been increased in camp and host community settings:
––Camps: 9 operational schools established in camps; 
––Host Communities: 98 schools double shifts to accommodate Syrian students. The expansion 
of an additional 102 schools has been completed and operational for the 2016/2017 school year; 



..Access to informal education (IFE): 42,000 children and youth were reached; 
..Access to non-formal education (NFE): 2,900 children and youth (Syrian, Jordanian and other 
nationalities);
..Outreach activities reached almost 200,000 community members through campaigns on education 
and protection;
..Access to post-basic and tertiary education opportunities has been increased, with over 500 youth 
attending diploma programmes and over 300 attending university level programmes (undergraduate 
and postgraduate).


2017 - 2019 Needs 

..Strengthening Education policy, planning and management: 
––Increasing the capacity of MoE to absorb all boys and girls eligible for certified education (formal 
and non-formal);
––Enhancing advocacy, resource planning and management to increase reliable long-term 
international support; 
––Developing the capacity of MoE to mainstream resilience into education policies and 
operationalizing them at school level; 
––Providing capacity support to MoE so that its systems are able to grow and adapt to changing 
needs;
––Developing policies to enhance access at the tertiary level; 
––Increasing capacity and resources of vocational education system to accommodate Syrian 
refugee students; 
––Facilitating registration process for Syrian refugees having lack of documentation required for 
enrolment.



..Delivery of Quality Inclusive Education Services: 
––Investing in capacity development for school directors to provide support and supervision to 
teaching staff, particularly temporary teachers in camps and double-shifted schools; 
––Establishing safe, inclusive learning environments; 
––Developing a Code of Conduct coupled with effective child protection referral pathways and a 
commitment to zero violence in school; 
––Improving and expand the quality of relevant alternative learning opportunities through non-
formal education programs; 
––Building the capacity of facilitators and strengthen community engagement. 
––Increasing professional development opportunities for all teachers (full-time and contract) on 







critical areas, including: (i) the ability to address the needs of students affected by the violence 
in Syria; (ii) school based management and supervision; and (iii) addressing needs of gender 
disparities and children with disabilities;
––Expanding safe learning environment (social cohesion) projects to tackle violence in schools;
––Introducing IT-enabled learning in formal education. 



..Access to Education Opportunities: 
––Ensuring all eligible boys and girls have access to formal education; 
––Providing access to alternative education pathways for those who are not eligible or able to 
attend formal education; 
––Constructing new schools and rehabilitate/expand existing educational infrastructure to include 
sanitation and hygiene facilities, and increase financial support to ensure regular maintenance of 
existing facilities; 
––Increasing post-basic education opportunities and provide safe spaces for youth to engage 
constructively in their communities;
––Scaling up and expanding higher education opportunities for Syrian refugee youth;
––Providing targeted support to offset the opportunity cost of education, which remains high for 
many vulnerable Jordanian and refugee households; 
––Expanding access to vocational education for Syrian adolescents upon the expansion of the VE 
system. 





 

Response Plan 

The education component of the JRP aims to ensure sustained access to quality and inclusive education 
for Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanians through the following main pillars: (i) increasing access to 
inclusive education opportunities; (ii) improving the quality of education delivered to all children affected 
by the crisis; and (iii) strengthening the government’s capacity to plan and manage the education system 
in light of the extra pressures on the system.

The education response will therefore work to boost the capacity of the public education system with 
much needed extra learning spaces. It will include remedial/catch-up classes for children who have missed 
out on weeks or months of schooling and access to improved and diversified certified alternative learning 
opportunities for both children and youth. Professional development opportunities for teachers will also 
ensure that quality education is not sacrificed. Moreover, to ensure equal access to all school-aged boys 
and girls for education, child-centred services in both child friendly spaces and schools will be provided. 
On the tertiary education level, the JRP aims to ensure expanded access to universities and community 
colleges.

The right to education is afforded to all individuals without exception, even in times of conflict or disaster. 
Those who have been displaced and those who host them require support to ensure that this right 
extends beyond access to services to guarantee quality and relevance. Recognizing that education remains 

SECTOR OVERALL OBJECTIVE

To ensure sustained quality educational services for children and youth 
impacted by the Syria crisis.



important engenders hope for those that have been displaced and will result in marked improvements in 
the lives of individuals and communities. Quality education protects against exploitation and ensures that 
an individual’s potential is not stunted due to uncontrollable circumstances. 

The focus on quality also recognizes the burden placed on the children and youth that share their 
communities and classrooms, and protects the education reform efforts underway in Jordan. It is with this 
recognition that the Education Task Force will work to ensure sustained quality educational services for 
children and youth impacted by the Syria crisis.

Sector Specific Objectives

The Response Plan seeks to ensure sustained quality educational services for all refugees as well as 
Jordanians affected by the crisis. The response plan links improvements in access and quality of education 
through increased absorptive capacity and professional development, with support for the development 
of an emergency response preparedness policy and resources framework. This approach ensures 
complementarity between efforts to address current pressures while reinforcing education system capacity 
to ensure the continuous delivery of quality education services in future emergency situations.

This plan is guided by the Sector Overall objective and the following three Sector Specific Objectives 
addressing refugee (REF) and resilience (RES) needs:

1) Improving capacities of education authorities to the continuous delivery of quality 
inclusive education services 

This specific objective focuses on supporting the government and its relevant ministries with targeted 
capacity development programmes to strengthen its ability to manage the current impact of the Syria 
crisis and plan for future needs and shocks. It addresses the need for strengthening how requirements 
and needs are identified and how resources are allocated and rationalized. It also considers the need to 
increase recognition of learning achievements and facilitate the entry into education (primary, secondary 
and tertiary) through strengthened policy and legislation. 

2) Improving provision of educational facilities sustains access to adequate, safe and 
protective learning spaces

This specific objective focuses on the inputs needed to ensure that a quality and relevant education is 
delivered to all children. Public school teachers and facilitates will benefit from enhanced in-service training 
opportunities. Students will benefit from more inclusive classroom environments that are also ICT-enabled, 
and teachers will be better able to provide specialized support. By focusing on the underlying root causes 
that are affecting student learning as a result of the Syria crisis, mitigation strategies will be developed 
and introduced to off-set negative coping strategies, reduce tensions in classrooms and communities, and 
ultimately improve learning outcomes. 

3) Increased provision of adequate, protective and safe learning spaces and facilities 

This objective will expand access to education from the pre-primary level through TVET and university, 
including access to alternative educational pathways and learning support services. It addresses the need 
to expand the current system, including new schools and additional classrooms. It seeks to ensure that 
access is inclusive and a safe and protective environment exists in all learning spaces. Additionally, it seeks 
to ensure that transportation is not a barrier to access education, and high tuition fees do not prevent 
youth from continuing or pursuing higher levels of education and training.

3.2.2 ENERGY

Jordan is one of the world’s most energy insecure countries, importing 96 percent of its energy needs. 
Energy imports accounted for 13 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015. During the period 2011-
2015, the total accumulative governmental subsidies for petroleum and electricity products reached USD 
7.1 billion.114 The total residential electricity consumption rose significantly from 5548 gigawatts (GWh) in 
2011 to 6,938 GWh in 2015. The consumption of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) increased from 370,000 
tons in 2011 to 420,000 tons in 2015. As per the latest statistics, electricity consumption in the northern 
governorates (those mostly affected by the Syria crisis) showed an additional increase of 2.3 percent 
compared to other governorates in Jordan.

The Syria crisis has exacerbated long-standing structural challenges in the energy sector in terms of supply, 
demand and management. Securing a sustainable energy pathway for Jordan is more critical today than 
ever. The Government of Jordan has made progress in this regard, with the elaboration of a National 
Energy Strategy, currently under implementation, and the adoption in 2012 of the Energy Efficiency and 
Renewable Energy Law, which provides incentives for sustainable energy solutions. A priority is to achieve 
local energy production, mainly by scaling-up renewable energy and improving energy efficiency. The JRP 
2017-2019 energy response is designed in accordance with these priorities.

In Zaatari Camp, population and commercial development increased the demand for electricity and network 
evolution, especially because electrical connections for shelters and businesses were implemented in a 
haphazard fashion by the refugees themselves and, in many cases, are of poor quality and present serious 
health and safety risks. The electrical infrastructure no longer has the capacity to cope with increasing 
demand and requires upgrading and expansion to meet existing safety standards. 

In Azraq Camp, improving living conditions remains a key objective. Since sufficient electricity has not been 
provided, there is an opportunity to create a fully regulated, effective electricity network that incorporates 
cost recovery and safety mechanisms.

2016 Achievements 

Approved energy projects reported in JORISS by August 2016 amounted to USD 18,917,354, allocated to 
the following projects:

..Implementation of replicable renewable energy pilots in Jordan;
..Protection, Education and Renewable Energy (PEARE) Program;
..Securing sufficient access to energy for the population;
..Increasing the use of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (RE&EE) solutions to satisfy increasing 
demands on electricity sustainability in host communities.


Moreover, a number of RE&EE projects are being implemented, together with a 2-year project focusing on 
the implementation of replicable renewable energy pilots demonstrating economic feasibility, technical 
efficiency, and replicability of renewable energy at Irbid and Jerash governorates. The project also aim 
to promote renewable energy at schools and household levels encouraging the mainstreaming of its 
applications. Agreements are also being developed with landlords of rented accommodation to reduce 
rents or electricity costs in return for energy improvements to buildings. Additionally, upgrades and the 
installation of insulation, glazing, solar water heating systems and other measures will improve efficiency 
and reduce overall energy costs.

With respect to refugee camps, several interventions are in place to mitigate the impact of insufficient 
energy resources, such as the upgrading of electrical distribution networks in Zaatari and Azraq camps to 
increase system capacity and reliability. 

114) Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Provisional Data September 2016



In Zaatari, energy consumption caps have been introduced with reduced supply hours. Camp members 
were trained as electricians to increase expertise and safely maintain household connections, and a solar 
power plant with 14 MW capacity will be constructed over the next two years. 

In Azraq camp, refugees received solar lanterns with phone-charging capacity, and solar street lights were 
installed. Electricity will replace some diesel generators, and shelters will be connected to a low voltage 
network. Moreover, a 2 MW solar plant is currently under construction. 

2017-19 Needs 

A thorough analysis has been conducted to identify key energy needs for refugees and host communities, 
as listed in the energy sector CVA. 

To meet the increased energy demands arising from the presence of Syrian refugees in host communities, 
there is a crucial need to accelerate RE&EE measures in buildings and residences across Jordan to offset 
increased short-term power demands. To reduce the use of fossil fuels and pressures on the power grid, 
efforts towards reinforcing renewable energy power supply capacities include establishing and upgrading 
the necessary infrastructure, transmission and distribution for additional medium-term renewable energy 
generation. 

Refugees in rented accommodation face the additional burden of high utility bills, which could be 
mitigated through energy-efficiency measures, such as water-saving devices, increased insulation, solar 
water heating and energy-efficiency technologies.

Due to resource constraints in Zaatari camp, refugees are provided with limited hours of electricity supply 
in the evenings and early morning. No electricity is provided during the day due to the high levels of 
energy consumption. The transition to renewable energy resources, together with energy awareness 
campaigns, will undoubtedly provide an adequate foundation to meet energy demands more effectively. 
Further investigation into cost recovery mechanisms is required to create self-reliance and sustainability for 
the refugee community and organizations operating within the camp.

Creating a safe, regulated and sustainable solution that provides a controlled, effective electricity supply to 
refugees, hospitals, schools, businesses and humanitarian agencies in urban areas and in camps requires 
significant investment. Central solar power plants would provide an optimal sustainable solution to meet 
energy demands for thousands of people living and working in the camps. Renewable energy technology 
could also meet hot water requirements necessary to improve health and hygiene for both urban and 
camp populations.

Response Plan 

Given the estimated levels of incremental power needed to respond to the Syria crisis in urban areas, 
responses can be aligned with . and benefit from . the new strategic investments planned within Jordan’s 
overall drive for sustainable energy solutions. Instead of developing new import-dependent power 
capacities, the suggestion is to meet extra loads through RE&EE solutions and to increase awareness on 
energy saving while building on existing capacities and initiatives. This would bring long-term benefits for 
Jordan’s sustainable energy vision. Moreover, while implementing immediate solutions to meet refugees’ 
demand for energy, it is imperative to consider long-term solutions to ensure sustainable production and 
use of energy in Jordan.

Sector assistance in camps is focused on providing adequate energy for every household for the purposes 
of cooking and refrigerating food, lighting and heating homes, lighting streets, charging electronics, and 



washing clothes. In urban areas, interventions should focus on utilizing safe RE&EE technologies at the 
household level. 

Within Jordan’s broad strategy for transformational change in both energy supply and demand dynamics, 
two key objectives are of relevance to Jordan’s response to the Syria crisis: (i) securing sustainable energy 
solutions, including those geared toward energy efficiency, to meet rising residential energy demands 
in the short-term, and (ii) expanding renewable energy solutions to meet the growing demand in the 
medium-term. 

Sector Specific Objectives 

This plan is guided by the Sector Overall objective and the following three Sector Specific Objectives 
addressing refugee (REF) and resilience (RES) needs:

1) Ensuring introduction, awareness and implementation of effective and efficient solutions to 
offset the incremental energy demand in a sustainable manner. 

2) Introducing and promote innovative renewable energy and energy efficient (RE&EE) 
technologies to reduce the pressure on the grid and support increased electricity needs. 

3) Providing refugees and host communities with access to an adequate, safe and sustainable 
supply of energy for every household.

SECTOR OVERALL OBJECTIVE

To accelerate and scale up efficient and effective responses to Jordan’s 
growing energy demands in a sustainable manner that alleviates 
incremental demand pressures from the Syria crisis.

3.2.3 ENVIRONMENT

The Syria crisis continues to have a wide array of negative repercussions on the environment. For instance, 
there is an increasing trend of environment-related violations to compensate for higher fuel prices and 
overgrazing of livestock due to the high cost of fodder. The number of cases that reached courtrooms by 
mid-2015 was an unprecedented 299 cases, of which 162 cases involved illegal wood cutting and 60 cases 
involved forest fires.

The Syria crisis is driving a sharp increase in air-polluting emissions. Air quality has been monitored in four 
areas vulnerable to air pollution near Syrian refugee clusters, and it is clear that the concentration of such 
large numbers of refugees in northern governorates is increasing the volume of emissions. Furthermore, 
Syrian refugees are further exacerbating already existing vulnerabilities in the field of medical waste. The 
average volume of medical waste generated before crisis is 253,506 tons per year, whereas the average 
since the crisis has risen to 466,789 tons per year. This is equal to a 184 percent increase in the amount 
of medical waste generated.115 The demand for pharmaceutical waste has also remarkably increased. The 
average volume of pharmaceutical waste generated before crisis is 750 m3/year, which has since increased 
to 1877 m3/year — a staggering 250 percent increase.116 Currently, there is only one dumping site assigned 
for hazardous waste and it needs considerable rehabilitation due to the increase in the amount of waste 
generated over the past few years. 

The Swaqa landfill has been serving as a dumping site for a wide variety of hazardous waste, including 
medical and pharmaceutical waste. Currently, the site is in need of clean-up and rehabilitation due to the 
accumulation of waste over the past several years. 

If not well-assessed, international cooperation projects can also have a harmful impact on the environment. 
In an already resource-scarce and environmentally fragile country like Jordan, this can exacerbate 
environmental stresses unless mitigation measures are put in place within the design of projects. This can 
also help prevent and address risks to host communities and refugees and enhance the sustainability of 
the response.117 Currently, there is no mechanism in place to ensure proper integration of environmental 
aspects into JRP projects. However, an environmental screening procedure for all JRP projects shall be 
established according to national environmental regulations to minimize any negative environmental 
impact, including those on heritage.

2016 Achievements 

A first-stage rapid assessment of the impact on the environment in Jordan caused by the influx of Syrian 
refugees has been conducted in 2015.118 The study addressed five priorities: water quantity and quality, 
soil degradation and rangelands, biodiversity and ecosystem services, air pollution, and hazardous and 
medical waste. 

The assessment study was prepared to inform a future comprehensive environmental assessment and 
definition of offset programmes, with the objective of minimizing the losses and associated costs of 
ecosystem services and environmental degradation brought about by the influx of refugees. The rapid 
assessment revealed that the natural capital in Jordan is under substantial additional pressure, the impact 
of which is reflected in lower water and air quality indicators and pressure on forests and land. Water 
over-abstraction and increased wastewater generation has resulted in accelerated mining of renewable 
groundwater resources and pressures on wastewater treatment plants. 

A new proposal for environmental screening has been developed. The “Environment Marker” instrument 
has been adopted for all JRP projects uploaded on JORISS. Through simple coding using A, B and C 
identifiers with a plus sign (+) for adequate enhancement or mitigation measures, the Environment Marker

tracks a project’s expected impact on the environment, and whether or not recommended actions have 
been undertaken. The tool is to be seen as a possibility to ensure that any negative impact on the local 
environment of a JRP project is minimized. Because of the lack of funding available for the environment 
sector in 2015 and 2016, no other interventions were implemented or initiated. 

 2017-19 Needs 

The importance of environmental risk is identified as a priority in the National Agenda, the Executive 
Development Plan and the JRP. The economic evaluation of the direct and indirect impact of the refugees 
on the ecosystems of host regions of Jordan requires in-depth scientific research. Such analysis would 
provide policy support to decision-makers with respect to the sustainability of environment, including 
ecosystems, wildlife and biodiversity. There is a need for an enhanced and expanded country-wide 
monitoring regime across a range of environment components. Air quality and hazardous waste are areas 
of particular concern. Furthermore, the Ministry of Environment needs support to expand the geographical 
coverage for its database system in order to be able to maintain records of all air parameters as well as the 
different types and amounts of waste. 

Limited human and technological capacities are also an impediment to the maintenance of the air quality 
monitoring programme. In Zaatari camp and surrounding areas, which have experienced a substantial 
increase in human presence and activities over the last few years, there is no facility that measures air quality 
and emissions. This should be urgently addressed in order to avoid possible health consequences for the 
local population. Overall, the treatment of hazardous waste is challenged by the lack of human capacities, 
equipment, proper installations, data bases, and proper monitoring programs. For instance, the Swaga 
dumping site is in poor condition with huge amounts of accumulated hazardous waste (approximately 
15,000 ton/year) and insufficient human capacities.119 The site requires immediate cleanup of existing 
hazardous waste, the installation of treatment technologies (mainly an incinerator), and a reinforcement of 
institutional and individual capacities for site management. 

Response Plan 

With pressure on natural resources projected to increase, it becomes urgent to address the adverse 
environmental impact resulting from the Syria crisis. The response aims at strengthening the resilience 
of fragile ecosystems and communities and offsetting the adverse environmental impact posed by the 
refugee crisis. In addition to the specific interventions outlined below to address critical environmental 
concerns, the JRP should mainstream environmental sustainability concerns as a cross-cutting issue 
across all sectors and all interventions of the JRP, especially those JRP interventions most likely to have an 
environmental impact.

Crises like the one Jordan is experiencing often have an environmental impact, either direct or indirect, 
that affects people’s health and livelihoods, as well as ecosystem services. If due consideration is not given, 
these can lead to further population displacement and socio-economic instability. Given the critical status 
of natural resources and environmental concerns related to a resilience-based response, it is recommended 
to conduct a holistic analysis of the implications of both the crisis and the responses in order to inform 
decision making and programmatic responses.

It is also prudent to put in place an effective monitoring system for environmental indicators, including

SECTOR OVERALL OBJECTIVE

To minimize the environmental impact of the Syrian crisis on vulnerable 
ecosystems and communities.



air pollutants, soil pollution, illegal grazing, illegal hunting, and the amount of generated waste. The 
monitoring system should focus on northern governorates that are most impacted by the crisis.

Sector Specific Objectives

1) Improved mechanisms to mitigate pressure and competition for ecosystem services (land, water) 
resulting from refugee influx.

In order to mitigate the additional competition over natural resources and ecosystem services, alternative 
income generation livelihood opportunities need to be created for vulnerable groups, including women 
and the youth residing within or near environmentally affected areas. Creation of green jobs and 
businesses for the surrounding communities of protected areas will decrease the pressure on natural 
resources, as well as decrease land degradation. This requires identification of vulnerable groups within 
a particular geographical area and undertaking feasibility assessments to design effective and relevant 
income-generation schemes that could serve as basis for future enterprise development. It also entails a 
component for enhancing the capacities of local CBOs with regards to designing and implementing green 
businesses associated with awareness on sustainable uses of natural resources. 

Furthermore, there is a need for strengthening the enforcement of legislation concerned with ecosystem 
management, which requires improving the operational capacity of rangers and the provision of needed 
equipment and tools including vehicles, GPS technology, cameras, etc. These efforts must be joined by 
further reinforcement in the arenas of environmental education awareness. 

2) Enhanced national and local capacities to manage hazardous waste 

Among the different types of hazardous waste, medical waste stands to be a priority given the considerable 
increase caused by the influx of refugees. This requires the provision of equipment for collection, transfer 
and treatment of hazardous waste, while at the same time enhancing the treatment capacities at both 
sources and landfills. This also entails developing human capacities in dealing with this type of waste. 

3) Strengthening monitoring and mitigation of air pollution 

There is a need for strengthening the capacities of measuring air quality, especially in areas close to 
refugee camps and in host communities, and including the strengthening of human capacities, equipment 
and field monitoring. This needs to be complemented by enhancing the performance efficiency of 
factories, wastewater treatment plants, and other emitting facilities in northern governorates, including 
the identification of potential sources of air pollution and the design and implementation of pollution 
mitigation mechanisms, equipment and tools. The Ministry of Environment is currently engaged in 
implementing relevant preparatory activities that are needed as a baseline for further enhancing air quality 
control, monitoring and management over the coming few years.

4) Effective institutionalization of mechanisms for environmental mainstreaming as part of JRP 
implementation.

The rapid disbursement of financial resources on a large-scale to meet the urgent needs resulting from 
the Syrian crisis will create both environmental risks and opportunities. Periods of rapid response are often 
characterized by “hyper-development” resulting in an increasingly severe environmental impact (e.g. 
increased demand for natural resources), often affecting heritage assets as well. This objective is therefore 
meant to help identify such environmental risks and opportunities and ensuring that they are taken into 
account as early as possible before implementing JRP interventions. It is recommended to establish a 
coordination mechanism within the JRPSC, in cooperation with the Ministry of Environment, to promote 
wise management of natural resources as a foundation for effective and sustained resilience, recovery, 
growth, poverty reduction and the equitable sharing of benefits.

There is a joint effort among implementing partners to develop an environmental marker customized for 



the JRP project, which can be used as an environmental screening procedure within the Jordan Response 
Platform for the Syrian Crisis (JRPSC) for all JRP projects in cooperation with the Ministry of Environment 
and in accordance with EIA regulation no. 37/2006, by which environmental risks should be recognized at 
the earliest stage prior implementation. UNEP’s “Environment Marker” was developed and used in other 
crises/response situations is a straightforward 3-point focused screening mechanism that could be adapted 
for use in the Jordanian context. It also contains guidelines for the reduction of environmental impact of 
projects under various response sectors and guidelines for the mitigation of the impact on heritage assets.

For those JRP projects that are likely to have a serious impact on environmental resources, and therefore 
require EIA assessment prior implementation in line with the national legislation, a higher level of 
coordination should take place between the JRPSC and the Ministry of Environment in order to identify 
and mitigate potential environmental risks in a timely and coordinated manner within JRP interventions, 
and to facilitate technical assistance for EIA approval. It is also important to identify stakeholders and 
provide support for developing appropriate frameworks for managing natural resources. The proposed 
coordination mechanism would strengthen governance and management of natural resources, prevent 
associated conflicts, and expedite approvals if and when needed from the Ministry of Environment for 
timely implementation of JRP interventions across sectors.

3.2.4 FOOD SECURITY

With the Syria crisis in its sixth year, refugees and vulnerable host communities in Jordan continue to face 
food insecurity issues. Although lower than 2015, 12 percent of households continue to be food insecure 
and 60 percent continue to be vulnerable to food insecurity in 2016.120 The number of Syrian refugee 
households in host communities with poor dietary diversity has improved compared to 2015, with 72 
percent of refugees also having an optimally diverse diet. This also follows a broader trend that refugees 
are shifting from using coping strategies that reduce intake of food to strategies that maintain access to 
food, such as borrowing food from friends or relatives or relying on less preferred and less expensive food.

For host communities, low and limited income remains the most prevalent factor restricting food access, 
compounded by rising prices as a result of the increased demand for food and non-food items. Food 
insecurity in Jordan is not only correlated with financial access to food but also with illiteracy, insufficient 
assets, large family size and nutritional education. In general, household diets of Jordanian families are 
characterized by a high intake of energy, largely from vegetable oil, cereals (bread) and some meat, with 
few pulses, vegetables and fruits. Household income is strained by the increasing cost of rent as a result of 
the greater demand for housing by refugees.

Agriculture is one of the sectors affected by the Syria crisis, with a direct impact on food security. In the 
areas bordering Syria, where farming systems are characterized by pastoralism, crop and horticulture 
production, the collapse of field veterinary and plant protection services in Syria has increased the 
vulnerability of agricultural livelihoods in Jordan to trans-boundary animal and crop diseases. Small farmers 
have to contend with price inflation in agricultural inputs and disruptions to traditional trading routes, in 
addition to existing challenges such as land and water scarcity, higher temperatures, insufficient rainfall, 
low productivity and limited market participation. 

2016 Achievements 

..In the 2016-2018 Jordan Response Plan, the combined Livelihoods and Food Security Sector 
proposed interventions to support crisis-affected and vulnerable populations by promoting their 
livelihoods, food security, and income-generation capacity. As of November 2016, USD 255,449,385 
has been approved for the refugees and resilience components of the JRP 2016 under the combined 
Food Security and Livelihoods Sector. The interventions in livelihoods in 2016 focused on strengthening 
resilience, providing emergency short-term employment and promoting skills exchange activities 
between Jordanian host communities and refugees. In terms of targeting refugees, the majority of 
investments have been made through volunteer and short-term work projects to inject much needed 
cash into camp households and economies. The sector’s key achievements are as follows: 
..Since the beginning of the Syria crisis, there has been continued food assistance to 611,472 Syrian 
refugees in and outside camps. The largest share of food assistance has been through food voucher 
programmes by a variety of organizations. Food parcels have also supplemented this assistance, 
covering not just Syrian refugees but vulnerable Jordanians in host communities as well. 
..Acceptable food consumption was reported by 56 percent of Syrian refugee households, while 797 
women, girls, boys and men were trained on good nutritional practices during 2016.
..Food assistance alone has injected over USD 104,872,194 million into the Jordanian retail economy 
through vouchers during 2016121 and USD 543 million since the start of the crisis. It has also created 
jobs for hundreds of Jordanians in the food sector. 122
..In addition to overcoming short-term hunger, school feeding programmes in the camps are an 
important source of support for the education response, encouraging enrolment and attendance for 
21,573 children (19,179 in Za’atari camp, and 2,394 in Azraq camp).

..Food and nutrition security of vulnerable Syrian refugees living in host communities and Jordanians 
has also been addressed through improved food production and access to safe and nutritious foods. 
..WFP conducted the 2016 Comprehensive Food Security Monitoring Exercise (CFSME), revealing 
the food security situation amongst the Syrian refugee population in camps and host communities. 
..A value chain analysis on dairy products in Mafraq was completed, resulting in a set of 
recommendations on improving the efficiency and productivity of the industry.
..Planning has also begun for a project to help develop the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture 
(MoA) in food security analysis, information systems as well as surveillance and control of transboundary 
animal diseases (TADs).
..A project aimed at enhancing food security and nutrition for the most vulnerable Jordanians 
and Syrian refugee households through improved access to safe and nutritious foods has been 
implemented in Mafraq and Irbid for 3,069 beneficiaries. Achievements were: 


a) Conducting a vulnerability assessment for 1,355 households in both governorates, through 
which 550 households were selected for participation; 

b) Identifying community-based organisations (CBOs) that supported the training exercises 
and will serve as demonstration hubs; 

c) Training beneficiaries on agricultural techniques for vegetable cultivation, community 
and homestead gardens, soil-less hydroponic technique for vegetable cultivation, nutrition 
education and cooking demonstrations; 

d) Distributing technical agriculture and cooking inputs to all beneficiaries. 

.. A project aimed at enhancing surveillance of transboundary animal diseases (TAD) in rural 
areas of Jordan affected by the crises in Syria was implemented with a total budget of USD 450,000. 
The objective was to promote formulation of evidence-based animal health programming in the 
governorates of Jordan affected by the Syrian crises. The achievements were: 
––Mapping and assessing key TADs of Jordan; 
––Broadening the understanding of the impact of TADs as well as needs of pastoral communities 
in Jordan; 



..Facilitation of the Regional Food Security Analysis Network – covering Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and 
Jordan. Relevant activities for Jordan included: regional coordination of meteorological information 
during the agricultural cropping seasons; conducting the Syria Agricultural Production and Cross 
Border Trade Study looking at the new dynamics of the regional agricultural and food market as a 
result of the Syria crisis and the implication for food security; and a capacity assessment of food security 
information systems and activities in Jordan identifying gaps in the data collection, data management 
and analysis, and dissemination. 
..In 2016, 16,775 Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanians were reached through food security 
activities, which included the distribution of food vouchers in addition to WFP assistance. Families 
received vouchers for a three month period to assist them to improve household food security and 
alleviate the burden on refugees to meet ongoing household needs. Moreover, food parcels were 
distributed to 10,775 beneficiaries in Amman, Mafraq, Zarqa, Irbid, and Madaba governorates. 


2017-2019 Needs 

The priority for the sector is to ensure that vulnerable women, girls, boys and men among Syrian refugees 
and Jordanian host communities have sufficient access to food without having to resort to negative coping 
strategies. Taking into consideration the increasing vulnerability to food insecurity among Syrian refugees, 



emergency food assistance needs to continue in 2017. The continued prevalence of micronutrient 
deficiencies and poor dietary diversity among girls and boys highlights the need for increased awareness on 
good nutritional practices through training and communication. This should be combined with sufficient 
access to fresh food, which is a challenge considering the limited economic resources of Syrian refugees 
and vulnerable Jordanians.

Efforts will continue toward increasing local food production and storage capacities of strategic food 
commodities, reviewing the subsidy reform policy, and enhancing access to food through livelihood 
interventions — all of which will contribute to improving food availability and access. While there will be a 
gradual transition from emergency assistance to livelihoods over the coming years, there will continue to be 
a vulnerable segment of the beneficiary population that will remain dependent on emergency assistance. 

There remains a need for supporting the national food security information and early warning system, 
which will result in more informed decision-making and resource allocation. Capacity development 
assistance is also needed to strengthen ongoing technical assistance to the government, which includes 
supporting the enhancement of national food security analysis, mapping, targeting and coordination, and 
the revision of policies related to the formalization of the informal sector and decent working conditions 
and wages for migrants. 

Response Plan 

To meet the urgent need for food assistance, the response plan will continue to support the government in 
reviewing legislation relevant to natural resources, food security and those with overlapping mandates. The 
response plan will also promote nutritional support to the most vulnerable through increased awareness 
of good nutritional practices, including training, communication and sensitization. Additionally, efforts 
will continue towards promoting dietary diversity — primarily in Azraq camp — through enhanced self-
reliance and local food production.

Given the increase in food insecurity amongst Syrian refugee households, particularly those living in host 
communities, interventions supporting recovery should lead to sustainable food access and availability for 
both Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanians. The food security response will focus on: 

..Maintaining the ability of refugees to access food by continuing food assistance activities to 
vulnerable households in a safe and dignified manner, while gradually increasing self-reliance 
opportunities for refugees. 
..Developing national and local capacities to sustain recovery efforts and developmental gains. One 
element of this is the continued development of the capacity of key stakeholders such as the Ministry 
of Agriculture and the Department of Statistics in food security and natural resource information 
systems as well as disaster risk management and policy development;
..Expanding the provision of healthy school meals to include children in camps and a wider network 
of schools in the host community;
..Supporting and expanding the capacity of households and communities in both urban and rural 
areas to establish family farming activities to improve dietary diversity and enhance food security; 
..Enhancing food security of Syrian refugees and host communities through support for food value 
chain activities;


SECTOR OVERALL OBJECTIVE

To enhance the food security situation of host communities and 
Syrian refugees in Jordan. 



..Promoting climate-smart agricultural technologies and practices, especially on the water, food 
and energy nexus, to improve availability, access and quality of food, in addition to promoting local 
agricultural production and marketing channels to provide high quality food commodities to Syrian 
refugees and host communities; and 
..Strengthening surveillance and control of TADs and transboundary crop disease and pests in order 
to protect the asset base and health of Jordan’s vulnerable population groups, reduce the impact on 
livestock and crop sectors, and safeguard their contribution to food security and income generation. 


Sector Specific Objectives

1) Improving availability, access and utilization of quality food for vulnerable women, girls, boys 
and men affected by the Syria crisis.

2) Promoting food security and maintaining sustainability and efficient productive use of 
agricultural resources by host communities and Syrian refugees within both rural and urban areas.

3.2.5 HEALTH

The demand for health services from Syrian refugees in Jordan continues to place acute pressure on the 
national health system. This is aggravated by high healthcare expenditure and the prevalence of non-
communicable diseases (NCDs) among refugees. Disabled, war-wounded, and older refugees also present 
significant challenges, particularly as war-related injuries require costly surgical treatment and lengthy 
rehabilitation. More than half of Syrian households suffer from severe or high health vulnerability,123 while 
around one-third of Jordanian children under below five years of age are anaemic, and vitamin A and 
iron supplementation is alarmingly low among this age group.124 Low tetanus toxoid vaccination coverage 
among women of reproductive age (TT1 65 percent overall and TT2 coverage 20 percent) poses serious 
public health risks and concerns regarding protection of women and their newborn infants from tetanus.125 
Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation at the north-eastern border is of increasing concern.

Due to funding constraints, the Ministry of Health (MoH) had to stop granting free access to health services 
for Syrian refugees, who have had to pay the uninsured Jordanian rate since November 2014. The needs 
of the national population are also growing with a changing population demographic and changing 
epidemiology of disease. Increasing healthcare costs of both services and supplies also raise issues of 
sustainable financing mechanisms for this spike in demand.126 Jordan remains at risk of infectious disease 
outbreaks, including polio, measles, H1N1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV). 
Around one third of the Jordanian population do not have access to universal health insurance coverage.

Identified Needs for 2017- 2019 

1) Health infrastructure and services are needed to deliver effective, quality, and integrated 
interventions, including: 

..Hospital beds and additional comprehensive health centres in Zarqa, Irbid and Amman; 
..A comprehensive, high quality package of maternal, neonatal, child and adolescent / youth health 
and nutrition services strengthened at Primary Healthcare services; 
..Improved quality of MNCH services at secondary and referral hospitals; 
..High quality, comprehensive, and integrated mental health and psychosocial support services; 
..Specialist tertiary referral services, including neonatal intensive care and neurosurgery; 
..Effective linkage and strengthened pathways of care between primary, secondary and tertiary 
levels of the national health system. 


2) A well-performing health workforce is needed to be responsive to achieve the best health outcomes 
possible, including:



..Nurses and doctors, particularly in Irbid and Amman governorates;
..Strengthening clinical and public health management in Ruwayshid hospital, Mafraq governorate;
..Mental health professionals and training for non-specialised primary care providers;
..Maternal, neonatal and child health to improve perinatal care, referral, hospital management, pre-
service and in-service training of healthcare providers, and management of obstetric complications 
and emergencies and referrals.130 


3) A well-functioning health information system is needed to ensure the production, analysis, 
dissemination and use of reliable and timely information on health determinants, health systems 
performance and health status (disaggregated by refugee status). This includes:

..Harmonizing and strengthening maternal, neonatal and child health information systems, including 
maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response;
..Improving national routine public health surveillance to enhance epidemiological monitoring of 
priority diseases, conditions and events, and ensuring timely detection of and response to suspected 
disease alerts; 
..Monitoring refugee health status, coverage and access especially for the most vulnerable, 
disaggregated by gender and age. 


4) Improved access to essential medical supplies, vaccines micronutrient supplements, and technologies 
is required with assured quality, safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness, including:

..Assessment of micronutrient deficiency and strengthened monitoring of national flour fortification 
and other supplementation programmes;
..Additional vaccines for routine immunisation within the National Immunization Programme; 
..The inclusion of refugees in and out-of-camps in the national neonatal screening programme.


5) An effective health financing system is needed to ensure all vulnerable populations can access 
needed services, including: 

..Reviewing and harmonising the health insurance benefits package,131 to reflect changes in the 
epidemiology of disease and population demographic of Jordan; 
..Developing a national plan to attain universal health coverage (including insurance).


6) Strong leadership and governance is required to ensure strategic policy frameworks are in place and 
are combined with effective oversight, accountability and partnership.

Response Plan 

The health sector in Jordan continues to face increasing needs and vulnerabilities with continued demand 
for services from refugees, a changing population demographic, changing epidemiology of disease and 
increasing rates of determinants of poor health. Rising healthcare costs, of both services and supplies, also 
raise issues of sustainable financing mechanisms for this increased demand. The health sector response 
strategy will provide durable solutions, maintain humanitarian programming and continue to meet the 
immediate and short term health needs of individual refugees whilst also undertaking health systems 
strengthening and promoting resilience. 

130) Including obstetricians, gynaecologists, paediatricians, neonatal nurses. 

131) A Comprehensive Review of the Health Financing System in Jordan. World Bank. May 2015



The strategy aims to reinforce the centrality of the national health system to the Syria crisis response. The 
response spans a range of activities, from direct interventions that ensure the short-term critical needs 
of Jordanians and Syrian refugees are met, through support for primary, secondary, and tertiary health 
services both in camps, rural and urban settings, and systematic investments that reinforce the capacity 
of the national health system. The response also aims to build the resilience of the public health system 
through investments in information management and logistics systems.

3.2.6 JUSTICE

The number of civil and criminal cases involving Syrians living in Jordan has risen significantly.136 Shari’a 
courts have also faced a similar increase and some of them have extended their working days by two hours 
to meet the increased caseload. 

Legal aid remains a challenge, particularly for vulnerable groups, including women and children.137 Courts 
are only mandated to grant legal representation for adults in criminal cases entailing the death penalty 
or life imprisonment. In addition, some studies on the subject found that most respondents had never 
heard of legal aid.138 This lack of awareness of rights and responsibilities amongst Jordanians and Syrian 
refugees, in addition to cultural preferences for alternative or non-formal dispute resolution, is an obstacle 
for individuals to claim their rights, which increases their vulnerability and their likelihood of breaking the 
law unintentionally. An estimated 20 percent of Syrian refugees living in host communities do not have 
rental contracts.139 The lack of a formal agreement means that refugees are at risk of being evicted or of 
facing housing disputes. The lack of security of tenure means that many Syrian refugee families report 
moving multiple times, which impact their ability to access services.

Many Syrian refugees in Jordan lack important legal and civil documentation such as birth, marriage, and 
death certificates due to loss or damage in Syria, or a lack of awareness of the need for such documents 
and the procedures for obtaining them. The creation of an office of the Shari’a court in Za’atari Camp has 
improved marriage registration among Syrian refugees, but no new offices have been opened in host 
communities, leading to a growing number of unregistered marriages and births. 

Jordan’s rehabilitation centres are closely moving towards full occupancy. More than 75 percent of inmates 
are detainees, whether ordered by prosecutors in pre-trial detention or detained administratively by 
governors. This results in financial burden on the Jordanian government and negatively affects confidence 
in the judicial system by the public. Syrians are more vulnerable when detention is weighed, as they are 
more likely to face administrative detention due to work permits or lack of documentation, and less likely 
to be able to secure bail in criminal cases.

Jordan is also in need to reform its detention policies and systems in order to limit pre-trial and administrative 
detention. The Ministry of Justice proposed adopting alternative to detention using electronic devices, in 
addition to alternative sentencing adopted in juvenile law and proposed amendments to the Penal code.

2015-2016 Achievements 

As of November 2016, projects recorded in JORISS totalled USD 3,556,200. The following cumulative results 
have been obtained during the year:

..MOJ established a Legal Aid Department within the Ministry to facilitate the provision of legal aid 
services in Jordan. 
..Civil society organizations (CSOs) played a major role in delivering legal aid services in Jordan
..In 2015, partners provided legal information, counselling and/or representation to Syrian refugees 
and Jordanians in affected communities (both camps and non-camp settings) to 70,648 individuals 
(27,647 women; 5,725 girls; 5,929 boys; 31,347 men).
..In collaboration with MOJ and the Shari’a courts, partners have organized trainings for legal 
practitioners and members of the judiciary on refugee law and protection of refugees, including 40 


136) According to the most recent statistics provided by the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), see MOJ, Statistics, 2015.

137) According to several studies: in 2011 it was found that 68 percent of defendants in Jordan did not have legal representation, and 83 percent in 
pre-trial cases; another study found that women are more likely than men – 26 percent versus 17 percent – to report avoiding court due to customs 
and traditions (World Bank, 2013). Social pressure also steers women from initiating claims directly with formal institutions. Nearly 70 percent of 
requests for legal aid assistance come from women (Justice Center for Legal Aid, JCLA).

civil and Shari’a judges, and 19 lawyers. 

..Two periods of exemption of fines for marriage registration for 2014 and 2015 were granted by 
the Office of the Prime Minister for the benefit of both Jordanians and Syrian refugees. According to 
statistics from the Supreme Judge Department, over 2,000 people benefitted from the exemption. 
..Significant investments were made in strengthening administrative institutions and practice in 
refugee camps, with the establishment of an office of the Shari’a Court in Za’atari and Azraq. 
..Additional premises were rented in Mafraq governorate to deal with the caseload increase within 
sharia courts. New premises were replaced with bigger buildings in different governorates.
..Nine reconciliation offices were established in urban sharia courts and two more have been set up 
in Zaatari and Azraq camps.


2017-2019 Needs 

..Many courthouses – particularly in Amman and Irbid – are in urgent need of new equipment, 
maintenance, and renovation. Additional judges and support staff also need to be hired to meet the 
growing demand for judicial services.
..Juvenile courts have been challenged by the increasing demand for speedy and child-friendly 
procedures. There are presently only three courts dedicated to juvenile cases, and nine more will need 
to be established to meet this extensive need and to be in accordance with the Juvenile Law of 2014, 
which mandated the existence of a juvenile court in every governorate for a total of 12 courts.
..There is a need for continued capacity development of MOJ and the Judicial Council on international 
refugee law and refugee protection. Legal practitioners, including members of the BA, must be trained 
on international law and the legal regime in Jordan relating to Syrian refugees. This also includes 
strengthening the coordination mechanisms among key players and stakeholders and the support to 
efforts to create a friendly environment for vulnerable cases.
..Continued institutional support and capacity development of the Shari’a Court on refugee 
protection, including in camps, is also essential.
..Access to justice is also impeded by a lack of information and legal awareness, scarcity of resources, 
and inability to travel to courts. As a result, the provision of legal aid is a fundamental need for all 
nationalities in Jordan. In addition, members of vulnerable communities must be informed of the 
availability of legal aid services and encouraged to seek legal assistance. 
..There is a need to improve research, data analysis and assessment to identify the gaps in the Justice 
sector and reflect the impact of the Syria crisis on the Justice sector.
..Continued provision of legal counselling and representation to Syrian refugees is also needed, 
with a particular focus on survivors of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), children without 
documentation, children in conflict with the law, and other vulnerable groups. 
..Community based alternative/collaborative dispute resolution mechanisms need to be mapped 
and supported. 
..Access to justice for women presents particular challenges. Due to the sensitivity of the subject, 
women are less likely to report disputes and, when they do, they are more likely to go to court 
unrepresented. 




Response Plan 

..The government and its development partners have committed to enhancing the capacities of 
MOJ and the Supreme Judge Department to deliver justice services, increasing access for vulnerable 
groups, including Syrian refugees, women and children.
..The needs are not yet met, and the capacities of courts, including Shari’a and juvenile courts, have 
been severely challenged in their efforts to accommodate the increasing number of cases in Jordan. 
The increased strain on the demand side of justice services means that facilities are dealing with 
double or triple the number of cases they are equipped to accommodate. At the same time, legal 
services for Jordanian nationals and Syrian refugees need to be enhanced, while improving access to 
free or affordable legal aid services for vulnerable groups. 
..To respond to those needs, the response plan aims to enhance the capacity of MOJ and all affected 
courts and the Supreme Judge Department, especially in Azraq, Ramtha, Mafraq City, and Irbid City, 
either by reutilizing existing space or building new courthouses. It will enhance the capacity of judges 
and prosecutors to respond to specific needs of various population groups through specialized 
thematic trainings and enhanced judiciary studies. It will improve the capacities of Shari’a judges 
on gender and child-sensitive judicial processes, and streamline judicial procedures as well as the 
infrastructure of Shari’a courts. 
..In addition, the plan will assist in the provision of legal aid services in criminal cases—particularly 
for felonies, and strengthen the efforts of CSOs in extending such services to impoverished and 
vulnerable communities. To develop the legal aid system, the response plan will look at providing 
the future national system with tools to operationalize legal aid and legal counselling mechanisms. 
It will strengthen the efforts of MOJ and the Bar Association to amend legislation and issue bylaws to 
regulate legal aid, and support strengthening the provision of pro-bono services by members of the 
Bar Association. In addition, it will carry out community-level awareness campaigns on rights, roles 
and functions of the courts, and the availability of legal services (formal and informal). 
..The plan will also aim to lower the increased burden on Jordan’s courts by supporting alternative 
mediation efforts, which can be implemented by civil society organizations for cases involving 
Syrian refugees living in Jordan and host community members. The recruitment of new judges and 
support staff will also serve to address newly emerging crimes, such as human trafficking, including 
of refugees, and other cases of exploitation. It will also support centres and legal clinics by improving 
their resources and accessibility, and establish new ones where there are larger needs. 


Specific focus will be put on including Syrian refugees in the national legal protection systems, including 
increasingly expanding legal aid services to them, in particular to refugees who are survivors of SGBV and 
children in conflict with the law. The plan will continue to invest in free legal information, counselling and 
advice for Syrian refugees in Jordan on documentation and rights and obligations in Jordan, particularly 
with regard to Personal Status/family law, labour law, and landlord and tenancy law. It will continue to 
invest in the capacities of the Shari’a Court and its Family Reconciliation Offices in the refugee camps so 
that Syrian refugees can access quality family law legal services.

3.2.7 LIVELIHOODS

In addition to the additional strain on Jordanian social services, the Syria crisis has also exacerbated pre-
existing structural challenges within the Jordanian labour market and economy. According to the World 
Bank, 14.4 percent of Jordan’s population lives below the poverty line, and a third of the population is 
considered transient poor – an ever larger share given the 70 percent population increase since 2004.140 
The vast majority of Syrians in Jordan are highly vulnerable, with 87 percent living below the national 
poverty line.141 

While humanitarian assistance has buffered many urban and camp based refugees from extreme levels 
of food insecurity and vulnerability, negative coping mechanisms remain widespread, with a reported 
26 percent of out-of-camp refugee depending on the income generated by family members in socially 
degrading, exploitative, high risk or illegal temporary jobs in order to meet their basic food needs.142 It is 
by now widely acknowledged that, while addressing basic needs, assistance programs are not sustainable 
and cannot foster a transition to self-reliance. 

Through successive reforms, the government has consistently worked towards addressing unemployment 
rates in the country, which have hovered between 12-14 percent for the past decade. Unemployment has 
disproportionately affected women and youth; in 2016, rates for women were about twice that of men and 
as high as 30 percent among youth aged 15 to 24.4 Real GDP is estimated to have contracted to 2.4 percent 
in 2015 from 3.1 percent in 2014, and is forecasted to rebound slightly to 3.0 percent in 2016.143 Growth 
rates are insufficient to provide enough jobs to the growing population. 

At the London Conference in February 2016, the Government of Jordan committed to creating 200,000 
job opportunities and facilitating business development processes for Syrians in exchange for increased 
support from the international community. Quotas for employers to hire Syrian refugees have been set. 
One step toward achieving measurable results was the agreement signed with the European Union to relax 
certain rules of origin. The agreement aims at improving exports overall, boosting the economy and thus 
increasing the number of jobs for all. These economic opportunities have the potential to allow refugees to 
sustainably meet their basic needs and contribute to the broader Jordanian economy. Investments to this 
end must recognize and equitably support poor Jordanians in order to be effective. 

2016 Achievements 

In the 2016-2018 Jordan Response Plan, the combined Livelihoods and Food Security Sector proposed 
interventions to support crisis-affected and vulnerable populations by promoting their livelihoods, food 
security, and income-generation capacity. As of September 2016, 11 projects from the JRP2016-2018 were 
recorded in JORISS for a total value of USD 10,441,220. Despite the professed centrality of resilience and 
system strengthening, only 3 funded projects addressed resilience of Jordanian host communities for a 
total of USD 5,621,770 million. The remaining are refugee projects for a total budget of more than USD 
4,819,450 million. The small number of interventions in Livelihoods in 2016 focussed on strengthening 
resilience, providing emergency short-term employment and promoting skills exchange activities between 
Jordanian host communities and refugees. In terms of targeting refugees, the majority of investment 
has been made through volunteer and short-term work projects to inject much needed cash in to camp 
households and economies. 

In light of the Jordan Compact, the scope for investments in livelihood has broadened considerably. 
Following the London conference, two notable agreements have been reached to generate employment 
and improve the investment climate in Jordan:

..A concessional financing facility by WBG to deliver development financing to Syrian refugees and

affected host communities;

..An EU-Jordanian Trade agreement relaxing the existing rules of origin, thus allowing Jordanian 
companies easier access to the EU market. Eligible companies will be required to employ a share of 
Syrian refugees.


Several additional pilot activities are being carried out in view of bridging short-term support with longer-
term sustainable livelihoods, including:

..Supporting the Ministry of Labour, and its directorates in processing work permit applications to 
facilitate achieving the agreed refugee employment targets. The issuance of work permit to Syrians 
increased through September 2016, with a reported 28,543 permits delivered, while only one percent 
of those are women;
..Supporting agricultural cooperatives in submitting work permit applications for agricultural 
labourers, rather than through the standard employer contract modality, through MOL and ILO; 
..Ad hoc job matching, information campaigns and dissemination of information; 
..Engaging in cash for work and short-term employment activities for municipal waste management, 
land management and infrastructure projects, as well as for services in the camps.


2017-19 Needs 

A considerable portion of the needs outlined in the JRP 2016-2018 remain unaddressed. Based on the 
implementation of the JRP 2016-2018, and in light of the growing needs and vulnerabilities, the following 
needs should be addressed for the period 2017-2019:

1) Immediate livelihoods stabilization and short-term self-reliance support for both Jordanians and 
Syrians: 

..Expanding short-term self-reliance measures for male and female Syrian refugees inside camps and 
Jordanians and Syrian refugees in host communities, which in turn will enhance local infrastructure 
and services in the form of cash for work; 
..Providing short-term employment opportunities in partnership with private sector companies for 
both Syrian refugees and Jordanians, thus ensuring decent work conditions and work permits. 


2) Sustainable livelihoods creation for Jordanians and Syrians through formal employment and self-
employment, meeting decent work and protection standards: 

..Expanding demand-driven vocational training and matching the skills required by the labour 
market in partnership with private sectors, and ensuring the economic participation of women and 
young men and women; 
..Facilitating job placements, including job readiness training, counselling and employment 
matching services benefitting refugee and host Jordanian job seekers; 
..Providing refugees with skills recognition, equivalency and vocation certification aligned with the 
labour market and private sector demands;
..Providing refugees with awareness and counselling about their labour rights and entitlements to 
minimise workplace exploitation and resolve labour disputes;
..Expanding start-up and growth support for enterprise development, including home-based 
businesses, targeting both Syrian refugees and Jordanians, with emphasis on women and the youth; 
..Strengthening the ecosystem of private sector development, including policy enhancement and 
network building. 




3) Sustainable economic development, including capacity development of MoL and local economic 
development: 

Providing support to MoL in strengthening policies on wage, improved labour migration management and 
decent work standards, in addition to cultivating an environment that is conducive to investments.

Strengthening stakeholder capacities to shape the strategy for local economic development, including 
value chain development. 

Facilitating dialogue amongst municipalities, community-based organisations (CBOs) and the private 
sector to foster participatory local economic development, public-private partnerships, and social cohesion 
between and among Syrians and Jordanians.

Response Plan 

Given the high unemployment rates among young men and women, and low labour force participation 
rates among women, which demonstrate the continuing need to create and improve income-generating 
opportunities, the response plan will aim to ensure dignified, sustainable livelihoods and create economic 
opportunities for both Jordanians in host communities and Syrian refugees, all the while strengthening 
institutional capacity.

The response plan will include steps for short-term employment creation that could help stabilize the 
livelihoods of Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanians, support sustainable employment opportunities 
and promote local economic development. In addition, formal employment creation through vocational 
training, employability courses, job-matching and self-employment creation through entrepreneurial 
activities will be at the core of the response in the livelihoods sector. It is important to note that micro and 
small businesses (MSEs) are the primary growth engine in Jordan outside of the public sector, yet many of 
these businesses face strong disincentives around the registration process, leaving a large percentage of 
Jordanians and Syrians in the informal realm and preventing their economic activities from growing and/or 
accessing financial services. Awareness of labour rights and entitlements by refugees will be mainstreamed 
throughout the response.

The response plan will continue to include capacity development to strengthen on-going technical 
assistance to the Government, which includes providing support to the Ministry of Labor‘s Inspection and 
Employment Directorates, labor migration management, the upgrading of its information management 
system, and the actualization of the commitments of the Jordan Compact. 

Acknowledging that both Syrian refugee and Jordanian women perceive childcare and household 
responsibilities as obstacles to women’s employment, measures should be introduced to encourage 
employers to create a friendlier working environment for women, such as flexible working hours; part-
time positions; reliable and safe transportation to work places; hiring female representatives s to raise 
awareness on and defend women’s rights in the workplace; and enacting policies to support women with 
childcare and household responsibilities. The plan will focus on creating an enabling environment that is 
conducive for women to work and to develop opportunities that women are more likely to take up. The 
plan also promotes access to financial services and support for in-demand technical trainings, and formal

3.2.8 LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND MUNICIPAL SERVICES

Prior to the crisis, local governance in Jordan was already struggling to address service delivery shortages, 
induce local economic development, and maintain social cohesion within communities mainly due to 
their already-limited capacity to address and financial distress. Meeting the needs of refugees residing 
outside camps threatens to overwhelm already stretched local administrations, particularly in the most 
affected northern governorates. In camps, government and donor funding has been provided to sustain 
minimum standards. However, municipalities neighboring refugee camps, such as in Mafraq Governorate, 
have received little funding to maintain and expand basic service delivery and infrastructure, or to plan 
settlement growth. 

Salary spending still consumes an excessive share of municipal budgets. Debt service has become 
unsustainable for many municipalities, and revenue generation is constrained by existing municipal 
legislation. This leaves little space for municipalities to respond to the increased demand induced by the 
refugee influx. Municipalities continue to lack equipment, capacity and logistical means to ensure the 
delivery of municipal services and to maintain their existing assets. 

The increase in population has had a direct impact on social cohesion as it exacerbates existing drivers of 
tension. It has also accentuated the perceived lack of participatory governance at the local level, with host 
communities demanding a more effective response to their own needs from state institutions and local 
authorities, especially in smaller communities. 

The solid waste management chain suffers from the growth in population and subsequent waste 
generation. Water, soil, and air pollution have increased due to the increased volume of waste, inadequate 
waste collection and disposal capacities, illegal dumping, and inappropriate disposal and burning of solid 
waste. This is also regarded as a source of tension between host communities and refugees. 

While the Syria crisis is profoundly urban, there is no systematic analysis of needs and potential responses 
at local and neighborhood levels to support more effective decision-making, resource allocation and urban 
response by humanitarian, development actors and government from an urban perspective. Meanwhile, 
unplanned settlement growth is promoting unsustainable sprawl and informal settlements formation. 
In the case of Mafraq, where there is unplanned settlement growth is currently happening in different 
directions, and the lack of planning guidance or proactive infrastructure investment may result in informal 
settlements emerging outside the planning boundaries, which are hard to contain and expensive to amend 
once they start.

2016 Achievements

..As of November 2016, projects recorded in JORISS have totaled USD 38,822,657. Over the past year, 
the following achievements were recorded:
..Budget allocations were made to a number of municipalities for procurement and construction 
projects, including those aimed at solid waste collection and treatment, community engagement, 
social cohesion and mapping of risks and resources;
..The Ministry of Municipal Affairs continued to implement the National Strategy for Solid Waste 
Management (SWM), which was launched in early 2015;
..A Master Plan was developed to rehabilitate and expand Al-Akedir, the largest sanitary landfill in 
the Kingdom. The Master Plan has become the basis for any support in the sector, and is supported by 
an Environment Impact Assessment that validated the site. An emergency landfill cell was designed 
to expand the lifetime of Al-Akedir site to up to two years; 
..Staff of the Joint Service Councils in Irbid and Mafraq was trained to operate and manage landfill 
operations;
..Projects are being implemented to improve municipal waste collection in Mafraq, Irbid and 




Karak and to support the municipalities of Irbid, Ramtha and Mafraq in reducing the environmental 
impact of waste in the host communities. This includes training for mechanics in order to increase the 
effectiveness of waste vehicles and their routes; 
..USD 53 million has been disbursed in grants to 16 municipalities in Amman, Zarqa, Irbid, Mafraq, 
Ajloun, Jerash and Ma’an; 
..Community outreach and engagement trainings were conducted in 27 municipalities, leading 
to the establishment of a National Training Team composed of community outreach graduates 
from the first phase of the Emergency Services and Social Resilience Project (ESSRP). The project 
aims at supporting Jordanian municipalities and host communities in addressing the immediate 
service delivery impact of Syrian refugee inflows in Northern Jordan. Community projects were also 
implemented to strengthen social cohesion and resilience in Irbid, Mafraq, Tafila and Ma’an;
..A Conflict-Related Development Analysis was conducted in Irbid, Zarqa, Mafraq, Madaba, Ma’an, 
and Tafileh;
..Three rural Municipalities in in Irbid and Mafraq are being supported on local economic development 
planning and engagement with community organisations;
..Capacity assessment and capacity building plans for MoMA and municipalities have been 
developed;
..Machinery and equipment has been secured for Al-Ekedir landfill; 
..A composting plant has been established in the Khadiyeh municipality of Mafraq; 
..A transfer station with roll-on roll-off technique has been equipped and prepared for implementation 
in Jarash. 


2017 -2019 Needs 

Local governance and municipal services needs were identified by MoMA and Task Force partners using 
the Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment and the MRR report. The needs have been designed using 
a community-led, resilience-based approach that includes mapping of risks and resources, conflict 
development analysis, and projections based on viable population growth and refugee influx statistics.

1) Municipal Service Delivery: 

..Providing municipalities with the machinery and equipment needed; 
..Implementing urgently required infrastructure projects, including road construction, street lighting 
and other public works;
..Constructing public areas including parks, libraries, community and women centers as well as 
sports and recreation facilities;
..Improving private sector investment and public-private partnerships.


2) Solid Waste Management:

..Providing municipalities with the machinery and equipment needed to alleviate the pressure on 
the solid waste collection mechanism based on the National Strategy; 
..Providing municipalities with training sessions and capacity building for staff in the SWM sector; 
..Constructing additional cells in Al-Akedir landfill and beyond the site to address the gap between 
capacity and total waste generation;
..Designing and constructing transfer stations across northern governorates to decrease pressure 




and financial burdens on municipalities;
..Introducing composting, recycling and other waste segregation pilot projects in municipalities 
and highlight the environmental repercussions of maintaining current practices;
..Constructing landfill sites to receive municipal solid waste;
..Developing a municipal solid waste management system that addresses maintenance of 
machineries, collection strategies and cost-effective systems.


3) Social Cohesion:

..Supporting municipalities in the strengthening of state-society relations and the participation of 
women and youth in host communities;
..Developing projects and activities that address the areas where tension can be anticipated between 
host communities and refugees;
..Strengthening the trust, communication, coordination, outreach and engagement capacity at 
municipal level to ensure the responsiveness to the needs of men and women, with a special focus on 
marginalized groups;
..Institutional Capacity Building at Municipal and Governorate levels:
..Strengthening the administration, planning, budgeting and information management in the 
local development units of governorates and municipalities with focus on citizen engagement and 
participatory approaches;
..Improving the capacities of local governments to implement better revenue collection with 
integrated land value sharing systems and registry systems;
..Strengthening financial independence of municipalities.


5) Urban Management:

..Addressing the immediate urban planning and management challenges associated with the Syria 
crisis and facilitating the coordinated investment of resources in line with municipal plans and policies; 
..Performing a systemic quantitative and qualitative real-time analysis of all sectors’ needs in 
municipalities and potential responses from an urban perspective. This should be done through 
an urban information management system to support more effective urban response, in terms of 
decision making and resource allocation, by national and international actors.


6) Private Sector Investment and Public-Private Partnerships:

..Establishing a legal framework for investment and partnerships between municipalities and the 
private sector; 
..Promoting business and job creation through establishing viable PPP models and revise existing 
ones in order to encourage knowledge sharing between sectors.


Response Plan 

The local governance and municipal services response plan targets major improvements in local 
administrations’ capacity and responsiveness, service delivery performance, solid waste management, 
social cohesion, and cross-sector cooperation. It also includes urgent required investment in infrastructure. 
The plan adopts a resilience-based approach by helping municipalities to cope with the crisis, recover from 
its impact and sustain the gains made. It links mitigating the effects of the Syria crisis with contributing to 
Jordan’s national development priorities.



Immediate short-term interventions will focus on social cohesion, solid waste collection and rapid planning. 
Social cohesion interventions will be concentrated in tension-prone areas and will mobilize activities that 
foster tolerance, co-existence and cooperation. The procurement of machineries and equipment related 
to solid waste collection will help municipalities and Joint Services Councils to alleviate the pressure 
incurred on the sector from the additional waste generation, especially in the northern governorates. 
Rapid planning and coordination support will be provided to municipalities and communities in affected 
areas. Medium term recovery interventions will focus on landfills, while the construction of sanitary cells 
will serve only as an emergency response. Financial independence of municipalities will be pursued by 
increasing revenue through assessing and improving the performance of existing revenue collection and 
eventually by introducing alternative approaches. 

Capacity building interventions will be implemented to help municipalities and the wider local 
administration structure in Jordan to plan for and address the needs of citizens and refugees, with a special 
focus on gender, youth and persons with disabilities. Participatory approaches to planning and budgeting, 
as well as better information management and coordination will be pursued to foster responsive and 
efficient local government responses.

Sector Specific Objectives

1) Improving municipal service delivery performance in host communities. 

Interventions will target urgently required investment and capacity building in municipal services and 
infrastructure, with a particular focus on SWM. In addition to these investments, interventions will address 
immediate capacity development requirements related to the different stages of the SWM cycle and other 
municipal service lines (e.g. road maintenance and development, street lighting, small/storm water and 
sewage maintenance works, parks and public space maintenance), while significant efforts will be made to 
support concerned Joint Service Councils to fulfil their mandate.

2) Revised local development priorities, projects, processes and systems to reflect and respond to 
changes and priorities arising from the Syria crisis. 

In the first phase, rapid planning and coordination support will be provided to municipalities and 
communities in affected areas. Subsequent inputs will capitalize on, improve or initiate new community 
and city-level plans that are responsive to population needs. They will focus on poor and vulnerable groups 
and the developmental challenges induced by the crisis. Moving forward, capacity development activities 
will be provided at municipal and district level, with a focus on outreach and effective communication as 
well as on participatory approaches to planning and budgeting. 

3) Strengthening resilience of local governance systems and communities to crisis with particular 
focus on social cohesion.

The third objective focuses on building resilience of local municipalities through interventions that will 
support the creation of an enabling environment for local public sector performance improvement, 
and Public-Private Partnerships. Technical assistance will be provided to municipalities in affected areas, 
targeting organizational development, financial management and fiscal autonomy. Interventions will 
also strengthen social cohesion through increased interaction between public entities, civil society, 
communities and religious institutions.

3.2.9 SHELTER

The Syria crisis is severely straining the absorptive capacity of the Jordanian housing market. In 2016, the 
overall housing market gap exceeded 100,000 housing units, representing a significant increase from the 
estimated annual average need by Jordanians. Pre-crisis supply was not well aligned with demand, with an 
oversupply at the middle and upper end of the market now translating into an acute shortage of affordable 
housing units. This contributes to tensions between refugees and host communities. The lack of affordable 
housing, particularly in urban centers where competition is the strongest, has been the most present cause 
of tension. In fact, 95 percent of Syrians and 87 percent of Jordanians link discontent in their communities 
with the rising prices of housing.144 This shows an increasing need to mitigate risks to social cohesion. Since 
the onset of the crisis, the rising demand and inadequate supply of affordable residential units has driven 
up rent levels, prompted exploitative sub-division of existing units, and the conversion of outbuildings into 
rental accommodation. 

Bringing additional and affordable housing units onto the market is likely to relieve upward pressure on 
rental prices, and tenants will have more options for better quality housing at better prices. Moreover, 
this will likely reduce opportunities for the exploitation of Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanians and 
mitigate the use of negative coping mechanisms among them. This approach provides an opportunity to 
link relief and development needs in host communities, where relief programming (such as cash for rent 
or completion of unfinished buildings) and development programming (such as affordable housing for 
Jordanians) can complement each other to maximize the impact on the affordable housing sector.

2016 Achievements 

As of November 2016, projects recorded in JORISS totaled USD 6,883,176. Activities in urban and rural 
settings are currently being implemented, targeting conditional cash for rent for the extremely vulnerable, 
upgrading sub-standard shelters, increasing housing units through the completion of unfinished buildings, 
sealing off kits, and awareness on rental rights and obligations. For camp settings, modifications were 
made to reflect lessons learned from Za’atari that aided in the planning of Azraq, ongoing activities in 
camps, and visions for the future plans of both Azraq and Za’atari. 

1) Host community 

..During the first half of 2016, the following was achieved in regards to the resilience component in 
the host community: 
..An extensive Affordable Housing Demand Survey was undertaken in eight governorates, (Balqa, 
East Amman, Irbid, Jerash, Kerak, Madaba, Mafraq, and Zarqa), and an analysis of the Jordanian 
financial sector was completed; 
..A supply-side analysis was done with developers, and municipality-level field visit work has allowed 
analysis on land prices; 
..A national affordable housing design competition was undertaken with and supported by the 
Jordan Engineers Association; 
..The construction of 14 model units in four different locations through the Jordan Construction 
Contractors Association was completed. 


During the first half of 2016, the following was achieved with regards to the refugee component:

..Cash for rent project supported over 23,634 vulnerable Syrian refugees and Jordanians across all 
governorates;
..Completion of new housing units in northern governorates benefited 5,000 vulnerable Syrian 
refugees and Jordanians;


144) REACH, 2015, Comprehensive reports analyze drivers of tensions and satisfaction with service delivery within host communities



..Upgrades and rehabilitation of shelters to adequate standards benefited 8,000 vulnerable Syrian 
refugees and Jordanians across all governorates.


2) Camps

..Zaatari: 682 shelter units have been replaced, improved or upgraded. Also, 9,400 square meters of 
camp infrastructure and roads have been upgraded.
..Azraq: Due to the huge number of new arrivals who have been hosted in Azraq Refugee Camp, 
4,224 shelter units have been replaced, improved or upgraded in four different villages.
..Other areas of focus in 2016 included upgrading infrastructure and shelter units, creating green 
spaces, improving living conditions and maintenance activities in both camps. 


2017-2019 Needs 

Inflation in the cost of rent has put Jordanian and poor Syrian families outside camps out of the market. The 
price range of new housing units has been between JD 30,000 and JD 60,000, making them unaffordable 
to low- and lower-middle income groups. In Mafraq, the price of monthly rent has increased from 70 – 150 
JOD before the crisis to 200 – 300 JOD in mid-2016. There are no entry-level housing options for lower 
middle income Jordanians, and rental housing is increasingly becoming less affordable for lower income 
Jordanian and Syrian families. Since the onset of the crisis, the consequences of the inadequate supply of 
affordable residential units has led to increasing rental prices, sub-division of existing units, conversion 
of outbuildings into rental accommodation, and some limited construction by individuals. There has not 
been a scaled response either from the private sector or the government. 145

In 2016; 29 percent of out of camps Syrian refugees have moved at least once in the previous six months.146 
Moreover, almost half of Syrian refugees have been on the move in the preceding year, reflecting the 
difficulties refugees must face in order to secure stable accommodation. In urban areas, 25 percent of 
Syrians are severely shelter vulnerable and 50 percent are highly shelter vulnerable.147 An estimated 10 
percent of Syrian refugees are under immediate threat of eviction.148 

More than 87 percent of Syrian refugees outside of camps are in debt.149 One in five Syrian refugee families 
in host communities does not have any form of rental contract, which is not only a legal requirement for 
foreigners living in Jordan, but also elementary protection from eviction and a precondition for registration 
with the MOI.150 Syrian refugees are often forced to live in substandard and overcrowded accommodation, 
thus increasing their vulnerability. According to the latest UNHCR home visits issued in 2016, 28 percent of 
Syrian refugees are living in substandard shelters, including 8 percent living within informal settlements. 
Out of the total refugee caseload in urban areas, 14 percent are living in one room and 12 percent are 
in houses with more than 4 individuals per room. The entire out of camp refugee caseload includes 20 
percent in accommodations that do not provide basic protection from the elements and 28 percent have 
leaking roofs, damp or moldy buildings. In addition to the threats of evictions and protection, substandard 
housing also affects the health of the residents who risk contracting respiratory infections, asthma, and 
other ailments.151 

For refugees in urban and rural areas, there is a need to continue upgrading substandard housing and 
increasing the number of affordable housing units in the market for the longer term. Many Syrian refugees 
living in rented accommodation lack basic security of tenure and are at risk of eviction, rental increases, 
and exploitation by landlords. Secure tenure and rental contracts need to be ensured to protect the rights

of Syrian refugees. Urban planning at the municipal level does not respond to existing urban sprawl 
challenges, and while it is critical to guide the location of new housing to align with infrastructure and 
service expansion, there is a need for integrated approaches, together with adequate capacity building for 
local municipal staff.

In the short to medium term, specific efforts are needed to address the vulnerability and deteriorating 
social cohesion in the communities, where the lack of physical security is most evident. Support should 
be targeted to those most at risk to protection threats, including gender-based violence. To complement 
humanitarian and development interventions, housing profiling is needed to adequately update the 
housing strategy that will address some of the long-term structural challenges in the housing sector. This 
new strategy will concretely demonstrate how humanitarian and development issues can be linked within 
a specific sector. There is a pressing need for improved monitoring of the negative coping mechanisms 
utilized by vulnerable refugee and Jordanian families to meet their rental costs, particularly those employed 
by female headed households, widows and single females. 

Targeting of refugees in urban and rural areas will be linked to the VAF, both in terms of overall welfare 
scores and shelter-specific vulnerabilities. VAF findings will be complemented by more detailed technical 
assessments and home visits. In camp settings, there is an evident need for continued investment and 
maintenance of infrastructure in both camps. Decongestion, restructuring and upgrading of overcrowded 
camps and construction of additional infrastructure remains a priority, including the construction of roads, 
drainage structures, graveling, fencing, security lighting, as well as maintenance of infrastructure and basic 
service facilities. Furthermore, upgrades and improvements of shelter units and weatherproofing are much 
needed interventions in both camps. 

Furthermore, in both camp and urban/rural settings, it is vital that people with specific needs (e.g. disabilities 
female headed households, youth and elderly) are individually addressed, also taking into consideration 
cultural sensitivities, such as privacy, family linkages, and origins.

 In host community urban and rural settings, the shelter response plan will continue to focus on the 
availability, affordability, and quality of shelter and on improving security of tenure:

Host community:

..Resilience-based interventions, such as the program for affordable housing to boost the supply of 
affordable housing units in Jordan, with a focus on the most affected governorates;
..A Jordan Housing profiling program that will aid in updating the Housing Strategy, which is are 
designed to complement expected humanitarian shelter programming in a way that addresses the 
structural issues affecting the housing sector in Jordan;
..Evaluating of the housing sector performance pre and post refugee crisis and its resilience; 
..Identifying weaknesses in the existing policies and ways to address the needs of the most vulnerable 
Jordanians and Syrian refugees;
..An Integrated national action plan aiming at building the capacity of housing sector key 
stakeholders;
..The Government of Jordan (GOJ), through the Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MOPWH) and 
with support of UN-Habitat, is adopting a new strategy to build the resilience of the housing sector in 
Jordan by applying predominantly private sector funded solutions. This new strategy will concretely 
demonstrate how humanitarian and development issues can be linked within a specific sector;
..Increasing the capacity of the housing market through interventions aimed at supporting 
Jordanian landlords for the completion of their unfinished units while supporting Syrian refugees’ 
access to affordable housing;
..Providing targeted conditional cash for rent to extremely vulnerable households, linking assistance 
to risk of eviction, protection concerns, negative coping mechanisms, and SGBV concerns;




..Improving quality of housing by upgrading housing in poor conditions to meet adequate standards 
benefiting both Jordanians and Syrian refugees;
..Distributing home adaptation kits and developing a winterization strategy for shelters that are not 
insulated or protected against damp and cold;
..Encouraging resilience and innovation by integrating energy saving, (i.e. solar panels, insulation) 
and water saving (tap fittings, etc.) components into the shelter response;
..Disseminating relevant information messaging on leasing rights and obligations;
..Conducting vulnerability needs assessments to measure the needs of men, women, boys, and girls 
using common criteria as are developed in the VAF. Men and women will also be surveyed to further 
understand their respective uses of the shelter and the degree to which the shelter/modifications 
address their needs;
..Developing better gap analysis and referral mechanisms to ensure that the needs of more 
vulnerable households are met, with a focus on linkages with relevant sectors including Protection 
and WASH, as shelter is the main entry point to tackle broader protection issues. 


Camps:

..Zaatari: Construction of internal districts’ roads, maintenance of camp infrastructure and 
replacement of damaged prefabricated caravans and winterization activities;
..Azraq: Maintenance of existing shelters and installations, improvements to existing shelters 
(cooking area, shower, shelves, home gardening, etc.), expanding of the existing market areas, 
upgrading of roads, improved accessibility between villages (light bridges, pathways, etc.), possible 
camp extension in existing villages and/or in constructing new villages. 


Sector Specific Objectives 

1) Sustainable and gender appropriate access to adequate shelter and basic facilities and services 
provided for Syrian refugee women, girls, boys and men in camps;

2) Providing appropriate shelter and basic facilities and services provided for vulnerable refugee and 
Jordanian women, girls, boys and men in host communities;

3) Enabling housing markets to meet the needs of all Jordanians.

SECTOR OVERALL OBJECTIVE

To ensure vulnerable Jordanian households and Syrian refugees have 
improved access to shelter.

3.2.10 SOCIAL PROTECTION

Jordan’s social protection system is well-developed and diversified, comprised of protection and social 
assistance components. Specialized police departments address domestic violence and juvenile justice, 
and a network of safe shelters and community centres serve the population, including those with specific 
protection needs or vulnerabilities. The Government of Jordan (GOJ) spends close to 2.8 percent of its 
gross domestic product on social assistance, with an additional 4.8 percent of its GDP spent on civil health 
insurance, social security, and civil pensions. However, the marked population growth in Jordan presents 
serious challenges with regards to social protection, with increased demands on infrastructure, housing, 
health, and protection services.

Amongst Jordanians, women and children bear the brunt of poverty. Women face higher levels of 
unemployment, lower wages, and are less well protected by social security than men. Persons with 
disabilities suffer from social exclusion and vulnerability, evidenced by low levels of literacy, employment, 
and participation. Those at particular risk of increased vulnerability include poor households, female 
headed households, survivors of violence, children deprived of parental care, children in conflict with law, 
children engaged in labour, children living and/or working on the streets, early marriage, children at risk of 
extremism and persons with disabilities. Violence against children (90 percent at home) in all settings in 
Jordan is one of the most common violations.

The National Aid Fund (NAF), estimated in 2013 that the direct and indirect impact of the Syria crisis has 
resulted in an additional 20,000 of the most vulnerable Jordanian families utilizing their cash assistance 
programmes, requiring an increase of USD 4.23 million in its annual budget. Vulnerability in Jordan is driven 
mainly by high unemployment and rising poverty. In 2010, the absolute poverty rate among Jordanian 
families was 14.4 percent and the abject poverty rate was 0.32 percent.152 

For Syrian refugees, the situation in Jordan has become more difficult due to: (i) difficulties in formalizing 
their residence in non-camp settings; (ii) challenges in obtaining legal work opportunities and increasing 
their capacity to provide for their own basic needs; and (iii) a decline of humanitarian assistance. With 89 
percent of refugees living below the poverty line, refugees are resorting to a range of coping strategies to 
survive, some of which increase their protection vulnerability. 

2016 Achievements 

..Social Protection Projects: As of November 2016, 50 Social Protection projects have been approved 
totalling USD 125,449,494. 
..Three Family Protection Department branches and three Juvenile Department branches are 
opened and providing improved protection services for survivors of violence and children in contact 
with law.
..A dedicated unit to combat sexual exploitation against children has been established at the FPD.
..Ministry of Education continues to implement programmes to reduce violence against children 
where rates of physical dropped from 26.92 percent in 2012 to 10.9 percent for the academic year 
2015/2016 and rates of verbal violence dropped from 40.21 percent in 2012 to 18.4 percent for 
2015/2016.
..Basic needs support has been provided to the most vulnerable segments of the refugee population 
outside of camps, with assistance provided to the most vulnerable 20 percent of the refugee population 
registered by UNHCR as of June 2016;
..In Azraq and Za’atari camps, basic needs for new arrivals were fully covered. All new arrivals to 
the camps were provided with a full set of non-food items (NFIs). 946,321 replenishment kits were 
distributed in the camps in the first half of 2016;


152) Ministry of Social Development, 2016.



..Since January 2016, 27,017 refugees have been transported from the border to Raba al Sarhan for 
critical registration and screening, facilitating access to international protection;
..23,784 refugees were submitted for third country resettlement, with submissions still ongoing, 
a substantial increase over initial plans that enables many of the most vulnerable refugees to find 
lasting solutions in third countries;
..577,052 refugees participated in information sessions (including awareness raising on services and 
referrals), helping to ensure that refugees are able to find the assistance they need; 
..13,355 refugees received rehabilitation sessions or assistive devices, facilitating improved wellbeing 
and greater integration in the life of the community; 
..8,348 SGBV survivors received multi-sector services to respond to and to mitigate the impact of 
SGBV; 
..8,560 Child Protection cases receive multi-sector services; 
..146,000 girls and boys (33 percent Jordanian girls and boys) have benefited from structured and 
sustained child protection or psychosocial support programmes. 
..108,000 women and men have also benefited from psychosocial support and better parenting 
sessions.
..125 safe spaces are operating to provide women, children and others with quality assistance in a 
secure and accessible environment, and
..2,798 children were issued birth certificates in refugee camps by Jordanian authorities, improving 
protection and reducing risks of statelessness.


2017-19 Needs

1) Social Protection 

..There is a need for expansion of programmes focused on community-based, multi-sector and case 
management services to survivors of violence, in particular survivors of SGBV and children at risk. Such 
programmes need to improve targeting of individuals with specific needs and vulnerabilities, including 
persons with disabilities. Programmes that target community and family support for caregivers of 
those with MHPSS problems, and programmes for those with developmental or intellectual disabilities 
are also crucial. 
..As the Syria crisis becomes increasingly prolonged, there is a need to bolster community-based 
initiatives that promote positive coping mechanisms and increase the ability of Syrians to support 
their families. 
..Access to services, rights and entitlements needs to be supported through provision of information, 
counselling and awareness raising activities, including on rights and obligations, personal status, civil 
documentation, and housing issues. 
..Specific channels of communication need to be identified in order to overcome situations of 
isolation and illiteracy, especially of women. 


2) Social Assistance 

..In 2017-2019, the key objective is to support the capacity of refugees to reduce exposure to negative 
coping mechanisms, using several approaches that include reducing asset depletion among refugee 
households in urban areas. This will happen against the backdrop of the Government’s commitment 
to allow Syrian refugees into the formal labour market, which presents a significant potential for the 
reduction of overall needs and assistance. 




..In addition to other innovative independent legal coping mechanisms, reduced exposure to 
negative coping mechanisms can be achieved through cash assistance to the intractably vulnerable 
refugee households in urban areas while striving for more cost-effective alternatives to in-kind 
distribution mechanisms in the camps.
..Among Jordanian workers, insurance against work injuries is regulated for 40 percent of the 
population; old age, disability and death insurance for 19 percent; insurance against unemployment for 
5 percent, and maternity insurance for 55 percent of working women. Fifty-two percent of Jordanians 
have no form of social insurance specified in their contract or agreement. In addition, social security 
remains beyond the reach of the majority of those informally employed, who constitute more than 40 
percent of the work force. 


Response Plan

The Social Protection response will focus on integrating Syrian refugees into national protection systems, 
as well as implementing quality social protection interventions prioritizing the most vulnerable (persons 
with disabilities, persons with particular legal and protection needs, the elderly, and the socio-economically 
vulnerable). The response will include social protection activities directed towards refugees and Jordanians, 
including through direct response and through strengthening of institutions and systems challenged by 
the impact of the Syria crisis. Social assistance priorities include meeting the life-saving basic needs of 
the most vulnerable refugees and Jordanians impacted by the crisis, through humanitarian assistance 
programmes and support to national social support systems.

Sector Specific Objectives

1) Strengthening and expanding national and sub-national protection systems that meet the 
international protection and social protection needs of vulnerable groups in the governorates most 
affected by the Syria crisis. 

..Ensuring continuous registration of Syrian refugees in camps and non-camp settings and the 
delivery of MoI service cards to facilitate access to services; and to provide counselling to Syrians 
wishing to return to Syria on the risks related to return. Efforts must be undertaken to ensure reception 
areas are as welcoming as possible for women and men, including ensuring female staff at reception 
areas and providing support for the documentation and referral of possible cases of sexual violence 
in conflict. 
..Strengthening national systems, focusing on integrating Syrian refugees into national protection 
systems, including through increased support to national protection services such as MoI/SRAD, Family 
Protection Department, Juvenile Police Department, National Council for Family Affairs, Ministry of 
Health, Counter-Trafficking Unit and the Ministry of Social Development’s social workers, and through 
enhanced linkages between humanitarian and national violence tracking, referral systems and 
Standard Operating Procedures.
..Increasing the capacity of national NGOs and civil society organizations to contribute to improved 
social protection services for vulnerable Jordanian and Syrian families. 
..Improving early identification, referral and comprehensive multi-sector response to SGBV and 


SECTOR OVERALL OBJECTIVE

To provide all vulnerable groups affected by the crisis with access to improved 
social protection services and legal protection frameworks in all governorates 
affected by the Syria crisis.



trafficking cases, including: early and comprehensive clinical management of rape and follow up; 
PSS, protection and other legal services; material assistance and other programmes to promote self-
reliance and positive coping mechanisms.
..Strengthening national child protection systems, provide timely services, interventions and 
decisions in children’s best interests, with a particular emphasis on providing quality multi-sector 
case management services to the following categories of child protection cases: unaccompanied and 
separated children (UASC), children associated with armed forces and armed groups, children with 
disabilities, child survivors of violence (domestic violence and violence in schools) and children in 
conflict with the law. 
..Expanding the participation of youth in their communities and other decisions that affect them, as 
well as in programme design, implementation and evaluation, including through the development of 
programmes that target youth through mentoring, conflict prevention, technical training and higher 
education. 
..Ensuring refugees can continue to access services and to benefit from their rights and entitlements 
through activities that assist refugees to: (i) better understand their rights and obligations under the 
Jordanian legal framework; (ii) participate in the urban re-registration exercise and obtain MoI service 
cards; (iii) document marriages, deaths and births; (iv) ensure security of tenure; and (v) better protect 
themselves against fraud, exploitation and abuse and know about complaints mechanisms. 
..Continuing to explore protection and durable solutions for Syrian refugees, including third country 
resettlement for the most vulnerable. 
..Increasing focus on Code of Conduct sessions for staff of all Government and humanitarian 
agencies, community-based organizations and other institutions working with refugees and other 
affected populations, and on expanding community-based complaints mechanisms.


2) Providing life-saving basic needs assistance to Syrian refugee households and vulnerable families 
affected by the crisis inside the camps and in non-camp settings;

3) Expanding in-kind assistance programmes — including cash assistance ‘graduation’ and social 
protection platform programmes — to reach increased numbers of vulnerable Jordanians in 
communities affected by the Syria Crisis.

..Work with other sectors to increase support to self-reliance programmes and community-based 
initiatives that reduce social tensions and promote positive coping mechanisms and psychosocial well-
being among Syrian refugees and Jordanians, including strengthening community-based protection 
networks. 
..Support refugees to meet basic needs as a priority, but phasing this gradually into a broader social 
protection logic, which allows refugees to develop and maintain their own assets. This will require 
in particular leveraging newly granted access to the formal labour market for refugees and a close 
collaboration under the JRP with livelihood elements.

3.2.11 TRANSPORT

The transport sector plays a key role in Jordan’s economy and contributes to over 8.1 percent of the 
gross domestic product (GDP). It is growing at an annual rate of 6 % and employs nearly 7 percent of the 
Jordanian labour force. The transport sector, as in other sectors, faces a number of challenges that have 
been further aggravated by the Syria crisis which demands that the sector keep up with escalated needs 
while continuing to support the growth of Jordan’s economy. 

 Existing roads in governorates mostly affected by the inflow of Syrian refugees (Irbid, Mafraq and Zarqa 
governorates) are in desperate need of expansion and urgent maintenance. The influx of Syrian refugees 
has increased the number of users of the road networks, personnel traffic, as well as heavy-loaded cargo, 
water supply, and sludge disposal trucks, which has led to a quicker than expected degradation of the 
existing road network. Furthermore, the crisis has resulted in enlarging the financial burden on vulnerable 
inhabitants and exhausted institutions. As a result, social tensions in host communities are on the rise due 
to increased pressure on public transport and roads networks which are used by inhabitants on their way 
to schools, health centers, work and other daily activities.

Another challenge is that Jordan has lost one of its major trade routes, and the escalating violence in Syria 
has forced the Kingdom to develop alternative routes mainly through Aqaba Port, resulting in additional 
burdens on existing infrastructure.

2016 Achievements 

As of 30 September 2016, the transport sector did not receive any funding to support the proposed 
interventions in the JRP 2016-2018. Nevertheless, the following interventions have been proposed /
initiated by the Government but remain underfunded:

..The Ministry of Transport (MOT) launched its Long Term National Strategy, which aims to create a 
clear framework for the next 20 years. Some key aspects of this plan included: developing a modern 
railway network that interconnected neighboring countries; reinforcement of Aqaba port as the main 
gateway of the country; setting integrated and complementary measures to increase the quality 
attractiveness of public transport. Several gains have been made within each of these objectives, 
including: 
––Finalizing the feasibility study for Amman – Zarqa bus rapid transport system (BRT), the 
construction is expected to commence in early 2017.
––Implementing the Queen Alia Airport expansion and rehabilitation project.
–– Integrating the national strategy into Jordan Vision 2025, which was launched in May 2015.



..The necessary funding for connecting Amman and Zarqa via public transportation was provided 
by external grants, and the cost of the project was estimated to be US$ 154 million. 
..The Ministry of Public Works (MOPW) has started a US$ 10 million project to construct several 
access roads in the northern borders, which is highly needed and critically underfunded.


2017-2019 Needs 

The transportation sector needs to address the following priorities:

..Develop plans for improvements of the public transport system to accommodate the increasing 
demands arising from the Syria crisis in the northern governorates that are most affected by the Syria 
crisis: Irbid, Mafraq, and Zarqa This assessment should feed the preparation of a comprehensive road 
master plan that will explore options for more efficient and reliable transport services and appropriately 




balances different forms of public and private transport
..Upgrade of the transportation system modes( lines and terminals) in Jordan and in particular the 
parts of the country that were mostly affected by Syrian refugees, as well as to enable MOT and MPWH 
in undertaking evidence based response to provide improved transport services to Syrian refugees 
and host communities.
..Expand, maintain and upgrade the existing road networks in Irbid, Zarqa and Mafraq governorates 
before they require a complete replacement as a result of the ongoing wear and tear; taking into 
consideration the integration of the needs of the transport sector along with other essential services 
(such as water and sanitation, education, health, and security) to provide services to the refugees 
in and outside camps and to building resilience of the host communities and municipalities. 
Interventions such as access roads and public transport services for the newly constructed schools 
and health centers as well as services needed to expand transport services to refugees residing in the 
host communities are highly needed.
..Rehabilitate existing roads and constructing new roads at the Jordanian Syrian borders, which is 
vital to maintain security and facilitate the transportation of Syrian refugees at the border areas. 
..Rehabilitate the main roads that connect Zaatari camp to Mafraq, Irbid and Amman. 
..Improve road safety across the country with special focus on the northern governorates 
experiencing an increased Syrian refugee movement. This should be coupled with spreading public 
awareness on traffic safety targeting both drivers and pedestrians. 
..Develop institutional capacities at both municipal and national levels in order to enhance strategic 
planning capabilities that prioritize the needs of the transport sector, strengthen evidence based 
planning and implementation of transport projects.


Response Plan 

In order to respond to the above needs, MOT and MPWH will work with relevant agencies from the transport 
sector to prepare a comprehensive master plan for the most affected governorates including Irbid, Mafraq 
and Zarqa. This master plan will explore options for more efficient and reliable transport services that 
provide different forms of public and private transport. 

The proposed master plan will consist of two phases - phase one will focus on conducting a needs /damage 
assessment of roads and transport systems; while phase two will concentrate on developing the roadmap. 
The plan will seek to minimize overall transport costs including direct operating costs of rolling stocks, 
infrastructure, time, security and comfort as well as indirect costs such as noise, pollution, and accidents. 
The plan is to have a better integration of related sectors and improved dialogue across ministries and 
departments in charge of transport planning and operation. 

Other areas that require urgent interventions are:

SECTOR OVERALL OBJECTIVE

To ensure the safe mobility of people and goods in areas affected by the Syria 
crisis through upgraded and efficient public transportation and road networks.



..Maintenance and of existing road networks, expansion and development of regional and access 
roads with high social, economic and environmental returns in cooperation with the private sector 
in order to meet the needs of Syrian refugees and host communities in accessing essential services 
(such as water and sanitation, education, health, and security) .
..Rehabilitation of existing and construction of new roads at the Jordanian Syrian borders which 
is vital to maintain security and transport lifesaving aid at the border areas especially in Rukban and 
Hadalat areas.
..Enhancing the capacity of Ministry of Transport as well as Ministry of Public Works in assessing 
needs and strategic planning. 
..Introduction and implementation of improved road safety standards.
..Increasing public awareness in matters related to roads safety and in particular driver and pedestrian 
attitude, through the media campaigns and schools/ community awareness sessions. 
..Transportation of refugees is carried out by partners in full coordination with the Jordanian Armed 
Forces. Agencies that provide assistance to refugees at border areas and, camps and in urban areas 
will also benefit from improved transport infrastructure including road network in the northern 
governorates.


Sector Specific Objectives 

1) Improving transport services and systems to accommodate the increased population in the 
northern governorates of Irbid, Zarqa and Mafraq.

2) Strengthening the capacity of road networks to accommodate the increased traffic flows in the 
northern governorates of Irbid, Zarqa and Mafraq.

3.2.12 WASH

Jordan is one of the most water scarce countries worldwide. Annual renewable resources of less than 
100 cubic meter per capita are far below the global threshold of severe water scarcity of 500 cubic meter 
per capita.153 Water demand has increased by 40 percent in the northern governorates and 21 percent 
elsewhere in Jordan. Water supply gets dramatically affected by sudden increases in population. Most 
renewable surface water is being utilized, while groundwater is being unsustainably exploited and 
gradually diminishing, leading to decreasing water levels and deteriorating water quality. Urgent and 
continued support is needed to ensure that the government, UN agencies, and international NGOs as well 
as other national partners are able to provide basic services with a special focus on the most vulnerable. 

It is estimated that 94 percent of households have access to a piped network. However, an estimated average 
of 50 percent of the water supplied is non-revenue water (i.e. water loss due to leakage, unauthorized 
connections as well as unpaid bills). Water supply is intermittent and based on a rationing system to cater 
for the shortage of resources. In the summer season, particularly in the north, water is supplied once 
every three and even four weeks for 12 hours of pumping. Ensuring more equitable distribution of water, 
implementing network upgrades and reducing non-revenue water are the key priorities for the WASH 
sector. This situation is compounded by the need for behavioral changes, more compliance to regulations 
by customers, and increased awareness on water as a limited resource. 

Water and sanitation are identified at all levels of government as a priority sector given that water scarcity 
and sanitation-related health issues are exacerbated by the presence of refugees.

More than 63 percent of the population in Jordan is connected to sewer system,154 though in specific 
locations this coverage is lower (43 percent in northern governorates). Sludge disposal and treatment is an 
issue that may threaten the environment. Due to the increased population in particular governorates, the 
capacity of the wastewater treatment plants and sewer network systems has been exceeded.155 This has 
resulted in overflows and blockages in sewer networks and overloading wastewater treatment plants. The 
state of existing infrastructure and the pressure from growing demand, require major interventions. As a 
result of the existing infrastructure and the demand, major infrastructure works are required. 

The Ministry of Water and Irrigation, through the support of donors, has implemented several projects 
to sustain water and sanitation services. However, less attention was given to the increased financial 
cost associated with operation and energy. Operation and maintenance recovery cost dropped from 110 
percent in 2011 to 70 percent in 2014.

Other institutions in host communities such as schools and health facilities were impacted as well. For 
instance, the rise in the number of Syrian students has burdened existing dilapidated WASH facilities. 
Only 32 percent of the assessed schools were connected to public sewerage network, while 36 percent of 
schools experience deficiencies in water supply. Overall, WASH facilities in 98 percent of the schools need 
improvement to ensure a healthy and hygienic environment. 

2016 Achievements 

Several infrastructure interventions have been funded, including drilling and rehabilitation of ground 
water wells, pumping systems, water conveyers and distribution networks. Improvements have been 
made in wastewater collection networks and area-specific rehabilitation of sewer lines, together with the 
improvement and rehabilitation of WASH facilities in schools and other public places, and water quality 
monitoring.

Other interventions included energy improvements of existing water and sanitation systems, creating 
awareness on key household hygiene practices amongst communities and refugees; building capacity at 
all levels of implementing organizations and in host communities in particular. Building capacities targeted

the management and use of facilities and services provided. 

As of December 2016, the WASH component of the JRP 2016 has received a total of USD 119.5 million 
in commitments. There are about 25 major WASH implementation partners, including all levels of 
the government, which has intervened in all 12 governorates with a focus on those with the highest 
concentration of Syrian refugees and residents. The JRP WASH interventions have followed the national 
standards and protocols applied to water, sanitation and hygiene service provision. In refugee camps, 
minimum standards have been developed and are being implemented to ensure a basic level of service by 
partners.

2017-2019 Needs

The WASH sector priority needs for the JRP 2017-2019 will target Syrian refugees in camps and Jordanians 
and Syrians in the most vulnerable communities. The major source documents and analysis used to 
determine the needs are: The JRP 2016 interventions that remain a priority and have not been funded and 
/or implemented; in addition to:

..The vulnerability assessment conducted by MOPIC/MWI; 
..The UNICEF Water Sector Vulnerability Mapping;
..MoE/JEN/UNICEF Nationwide WASH in Schools assessment; 
..The Jordan Development and Investment plan; 
..The National Water Strategy 2016-2025.


Using the above source documents and analysis will bring greater specificity and focus on the most 
vulnerable populations and localities. Based on the above vulnerability criteria and the unfunded 
interventions of the JRP 2016, the following WASH sector priorities have been identified for the JRP 2017-
2019 implementation: 

..Ensuring sustainable water supply to all vulnerable households and communities in high refugee

goals;
..Improving wastewater system by increasing sewer network coverage and treatment plant capacity 
a as per CVA and SVA;
..Promoting the reuse of treated water;
..Maintaining hygiene and water conservation practice in vulnerable households and communities;
..Improving access to water and sanitation in public schools, health facilities and child friendly spaces

Around 57 percent of resilience-based WASH interventions in the JRP 2016 remain unfunded. These 
WASH interventions were planned on established priority needs of vulnerable Jordanian populations in 
the northern and central governorates with high refugee concentrations. Around 4 million Jordanians 
and Syrians live in 13 localities (sub-districts) in five governorates are facing high to severe water related 
vulnerability. Similarly for sanitation, around 2.15 million Jordanians and Syrians live in five governorates 
in 25 sub-districts fall between severe and high vulnerability. Additionally, based on the above, WAJ/PMU 
have identified 28 major interventions for infrastructure improvement, system strengthening (including 
monitoring) and capacity development covering all vulnerable communities and governorates requiring 
support.

Furthermore, internally for the WASH sector, it would be helpful to develop a national humanitarian WASH 
coordination framework and implementation plan that enables the MWI and its agencies to be “disaster 
ready” and be able to respond to any WASH-related disaster, conflict, or epidemic.

Response Plan

In reference to the above situation analysis, Jordan is facing challenges regarding water and wastewater 
services, which is further exacerbated by the excess demand arising from the influx of Syrian refugees. 
There is a specific risk associated with the WASH needs of both Syrian refugees and Jordanians living in host 
communities in terms of cost and efforts and a persistent risk of “failure to deliver.”156 

Sector Specific Objectives

1) Quantity, quality and efficiency of safe drinking water delivery improved and system optimized

2) Sanitation services expanded and improved

3) Strengthened Sector planning, implementation, monitoring and coordination

4) Sustainable provision of safe and equitable access to water services in camps and host communities as 
per minimum standards

5) Providing safe and equitable access to gender appropriate sanitation services in camps.

6) Improving environmental health as a result of the practice of key hygiene activities. 

The JRP WASH 2017-19 will focus on the following interventions for both refugee and resilience responses:

..Rehabilitating and enhancing water and sanitation infrastructure in host communities and refugee

settlements (outside camps) to restore the adequacy and efficiency of safe water distribution and 
sewerage collection networks;

..Installing new/upgrade existing sewerage treatment facilities to meet the additional & expanded 
demand for collection and treatment of waste and wastewater and to prevent epidemics;
..Rehabilitating and improving water distribution networks to reduce NRW and improve system 
efficiency;
..Improving WASH conditions in schools; 
..Improving water quality monitoring;
..Developing sector capacity through national and subnational institutional improvements;
..Fostering partnerships for funding and technical support, private sector investment, and NGO 
contribution in order to accelerate and improve implementation of projects; 
..Improving sector coordination, project management and performance monitoring/reporting;
..Ensuring quality implementation of projects by building the capacities and strengthening the 
performance monitoring of service providers, including water utilities;
..Supporting wastewater reuse where possible. 


It is important to note that, since water systems are interlinked. Interventions in one geographical area may 
necessitate subsequent interventions in other areas in order to achieve the desired outcomes. This is also 
the case for wastewater systems.

In order to administer the JRP funding and implementation, the Ministry of Water and Irrigation will work 
closely with MoPIC, JRPSC and other sector partners to advocate and to ensure efficiency and timeliness in 
the technical appraisal and subsequent approval of proposals based on priority interventions. There is also 
a need to recognize NGOs and private sector organizations, and to include their work in JORISS to ensure 
the harmonization and coordination of national response proposals. 

The WASH Task Force would guide the coordinated development and implementation of the mentioned 
work plans, budgets and capacity development plans. It will provide guidance and recommendations, 
highlight issues for urgent action and ensure follow-up on issues of strategic importance. Projects will 
be implemented on the basis of individual and/or collective cluster of interventions that have a common 
geographical focus, complementary implementation capacities, and existing infrastructure to implement 
activities as per approved work plans and budgets.

The impact of the Syria crisis on Jordan is multifaceted, spanning almost all sectors of the economy and 
affecting – with varying degrees of intensity – all geographic areas. On the macroeconomic side, the crisis 
continues to aggravate economic difficulties and exacerbate existing vulnerabilities, thereby casting a 
shadow over public finance performance. In particular, the crisis has placed a significant burden on budgets 
and is overstretching services across all affected sectors. 

This chapter provides an estimate of the direct and indirect costs of the crisis borne by Jordan. The direct 
cost of the Syria crisis includes the monetary impact on Jordan’s budget (such as subsidies, income loss and 
tariffs loss) and on JRP sectors. Indirect costs are assessed using the CVA results, in addition to other indirect 
estimates provided by relevant line ministries and the findings of a recent UNDP study.157

While some sectors may have benefited from the population increase, the overall impact of the crisis on 
the economy has been detrimental. Although the pressure of almost 1.3 million Syrians, is an important 
component of this impact, it represents only part of the picture. Another primary destabilizing economic 
factor has been the regional trade distortions caused by the crisis, which is directly linked to increasing 
levels of national debt and a worsening trade deficit. 

4.1 MACROECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF THE CRISIS

Capturing the whole impact of the Syria crisis is a challenge, not only because of the difficulty of defining the 
cause-effect relation along with their attributions and linkages, but also due to the difficulty of identifying 
the starting and ending points of the impact and its consequences. This in addition to the difficulty of 
delineating lines between direct and indirect impact as well as gauging and quantifying the impact.

The macroeconomic indicators witnessed a marked slowdown as the GDP growth has declined by 60 
percent, the trade deficit has increased by 57 percent, income from tourism growth rate declined by 75 
percent and grants to Jordan have declined by 185 percent during the period 2011-2015 when compared 
by the period 2006-2010 as the grants increased from USD 304 million in 2006 to USD 402 million in 2010 
while it has decreased from USD 1,215 million in 2011 to USD 886 million in 2015. 

The major macroeconomic impact can be summarized as following:

..Sharp decrease in GDP growth rate falling from 76 percent during the period 2006-2010 to 30 
percent during 2011-2015. It is worth noting that GDP growth during the first half of 2016 reached 2.3 
percent .158
..The debt (national and foreign) has witnessed soaring increase during the crisis period, it increased

by 70 percent during the crisis period compared to 56 percent increase before the crisis. The ratio of 
debt to GDP has risen from 65 percent in 2011 to 86 percent in 2015.

..The unemployment ratio has decreased by 11 percent five years before the crisis while it has 
remained somewhat steady at around 13 percent in the five years after the crisis. The unemployment 
ratio jumped from 12.4 percent in 2010 to 15.8 percent in September 2016.159 
..Foreign grants to Jordan has plummeted during the 2011-2015 period to 27 percent compared to 
a 32 percent increase during the period 2006-2010.


Public debt has increased by 70 percent since 2011 compared to 56 percent between 2006 and 2010, 
reaching 86 percent of GDP in 2015.160 Government expenditure in 2015 stood at 7.7 JOD billion, down 
by 126.5 JOD million from the year before when expenditure reached 7.851 JOD billion.161 Despite the 
additional financing needs arising from the crisis, the budget deficit continued to decrease from its 2012 
high.162 At the end of 2015 the deficit (including grants) rose to 3.4% (JOD 929 million) compared to 2.3% 
(JOD 585.3 million) in 2014.163 

Trade has also been badly affected by the crisis, with the disruption of the Syria and Turkey traffic and 
trading routes, leading to sharp increase in the trade deficit, which has multiplied six-fold since the start of 
the crisis. In the five-year period prior to the Syria crisis, the trade deficit increased by 30 percent. Between 
2011 and 2015 however, the deficit decreased by 13 percent. This is largely driven by disruptions to Jordan’s 
main trade route through Syria: from 2006 to 2010 exports rose by 44 percent compared with a decline of 
0.2 percent between 2011 and 2015. 

Finally, tourism sector has also been affected. Between 2006 and 2010 tourist numbers increased by 154 
percent. Between 2011 and 2015, however, there has been a decrease by 28 percent. At the same time 
income from tourism -which had been growing before the crisis by 74 percent over the course of five years- 
has dropped to 19 percent in the five years since the crisis.

TABLE (1): MAJOR MACRO-ECONOMIC INDICATORS



4.2 SECTOR IMPACT OF THE SYRIA CRISIS

The calculation of the direct and indirect impact of the Syria crisis on Jordan is based upon the following 
parameters and assumptions:

1) The total population of Jordan is 9.531 million. Annual population growth stands at 2.4 percent.164
2) The total number of Syrian nationals is 1.266 million (December 2015); 655,833 are registered refugees. 
The Syrian population is projected to increase by 3 percent annually.165
3) Out of the registered Syrian refugees, some 141,318 live inside the camps.166
4) The calculation is based on government budget information.
5) Despite the fact that there are different consumption patterns and service delivery costs between 
refugees and Jordanian citizens, per capita costs were considered equal for both populations.
6) The costs of Syrian refugees inside camps were calculated differently than outside camps. 
7) Only fiscal impact that cannot be mitigated through programmatic interventions are reflected in 
section 4.4 of the present chapter.


The costs below are an estimate based on the Ministry of Finance (MOF) budget projections for 2017-2019. 
They do not reflect the full cost attributable to the Syrian population in Jordan, as they do not quantify all 
environmental and social costs that may have ensued from the Syria crisis. The methodology used depends 
on the sector. For some sectors (such as Education, Health, Water, Food Subsidies, and Security), a per 
capita cost for each year was multiplied by the total number of refugees and/or total Syrian population (or 
Syrian students for the Education sector).

Education

The total direct financial cost for the education sector for the period 2017- 2019 will be around USD 139.6 
million per year, based on Ministry of Education (MOE) indicative budget for 2017-2019.

The indirect impact in the public education sector service delivery can also be further examined. For 
example, the pressure on the education sector is perceived to have slowed down typical classroom 
learning because of a need to introduce a large number of students who have been out of school to a 
new curriculum. Also, the increase in the number of students has forced the MOE to appoint teachers with 
limited competency and experience, thus compromising the quality of education and in turn leading to an 
increase in out-of-pocket education expenses due to the use of private teachers. 

It is worth noting that the UNDP study expected that the increase in the number of Syrian refugees in 
schools will have a negative indirect impact by increasing the dropout rate, reducing school progression, 
and the average number of years of education. This in turn will negatively affect labour force participation 
rate and unemployment rate and consequently reflect indirectly on economic growth.

164) According to the Population and Housing Census report released in late February 2016. 

165) A total of 655,833 refugees are registered with UNHCR as of 07 November 2016.

166) A total of 141,318 refugees live in-camp according to UNHCR (retrieved 22 November 2016).



This indirect decrease in economic growth can be translated into monetary basis amounted on average to 
USD 384.2 million per year in the long run (i.e. ten years from now). Another issue to consider is the delays 
in implementing national education reform plans and loss of current education gains due to the Syrian 
Crisis. Furthermore, and despite the degradation in safe school environment and the increase of violence 
in schools, especially in sever and high vulnerable areas; host communities have benefited from the access 
to education infrastructure and services rendered by the MOE and the donor community to mitigate the 
impacts of the Syrian crisis. 

In addition, the Syrian Crisis has contributed to providing thousands of job opportunities in the education 
service delivery and additional income generation to teachers through “Private Lessons”. However, despite 
all, the enrolment rates in Jordan has remained stable. The Ministry of Education reported net enrolment 
rates of 38.26 percent in pre-primary school, 98.02 percent in primary school, and 72.56 percent in secondary 
school during the 2014-15 academic year. Jordan’s net primary school enrolment rate, before and since the 
Syria conflict began, has remained at around 97 percent. 

Health

The total direct financial cost of Syrians for the health sector is estimated to be around USD 118.3 million 
per year for the period 2017-19.

The indirect costs in the public health sector are calculated at around USD 16.5 million.167 These costs include 
the following negative spillover effects: increased demand for health care services; rise in communicable 
diseases; overcrowding of Jordanians from public services; risks of increased infections, as a result of lack of 
water and sanitation; medication shortages, and finally malnutrition.168

It is also worth noting that a recent UNDP study has pointed out an indirect impact as a result of the 
reduction in per capita income in the main hosting area of refugees in the country (Amman, Irbid, Zarqa, 
and Mafraq) is amounted to USD 16.5 million as a in indirect cost on the well-being of individuals in the 
economy.

Electricity

The direct cost of the crisis on electricity for the period 2017-2019 is explained in the below table (as

The cost of the crisis on the energy sector is calculated by quantifying the total value of subsidies that 
the Syrian population benefits from. There are 317,000 Syrian subscribers from a total number of 836,000 
subsidized subscribers. The average consumption in the subsidized household category is 4,710 gigawatts, 
at a tariff of 33 fills per kilowatt, against a cost of 104 fills. Based on the above, around USD 183.3 million 
subsidies per year out of a total of USD 496.7 million is attributable to the Syria crisis.

The table is based on Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MOWI) calculations that include direct and indirect 
cost. For the calculations, it was assumed that Syrian population water consumption patterns are the same 
as those of the Jordanian population.

The financial cost of water and wastewater services consists of direct and indirect costs. The direct cost 
results from the operation and maintenance cost and the capital investment in the infrastructure paid 
directly by the water organizations that provide water and wastewater services in Jordan. The operation 
and maintenance cost is estimated at USD 44.3 per person, while the direct capital cost is estimated at USD 
42.9 per person. On this basis, the direct financial cost to serve a Syrian population of 1.15 million living in 
host communities reaches up to USD 100.3 million.

The indirect costs are related to the expected cost in future due to the required capital investment and 
crisis management. The future capital cost is estimated at USD 183.2 per person. An additional 12.5 percent 
on both capital and operation costs is calculated to compensate for managing the Syrian population under 
the crisis. Based on the estimated cost at USD 270.4 per person, crisis management cost is estimated at USD 
33.9 per person. This brings up the total indirect cost of hosting Syrian population to USD 249.6 million.

As for the Syrian refugees in camps, the average water supply is set to 35 liters per person per day. This 
is equivalent to about 12.8 cubic meter per year. This water is provided through water tankers at an 
average cost of USD 3.72 per cubic meter, which is the direct cost of water supply. Moreover, the generated 
wastewater per refugee is estimated at 9.84 cubic meter per year, which is about 77 percent of average of 
water usage. The average cost of treating the generated wastewater is about USD 3 per cubic meter. 

On this basis, the annual direct financial cost to provide water and sanitation services to a population of 
114,846 Syrian refugees living in camps is estimated at USD 5,463,041 for water supply survives and USD 
3,379,096 for wastewater services. This brings up the total direct financial cost of water and sanitation 
services to USD 8,842,138. This cost does not include the cost of capital cost for infrastructure needed.

Public Works

The direct cost of the crisis on public works is estimated at a USD 176 million per year for the period 2017-
2019, as per the below table:

Municipalities

Using the increased total debt of municipalities, it can be estimated that the total direct cost for municipalities 
to provide services to Syrians in Jordan will reach an average of around USD 26 million per year for the 
period 2017-2019, as per the below table:

The CVA assesses the indirect cost of the crisis on municipality service delivery using two main indicators: 
The ratio of working compressors to the total volume of waste produced per day and the landfill capacity. 
The capacity of municipalities to manage the waste has been exceeded by 11 percent, 85 percent of which 
is attributable to the Syria crisis. In total, 32 new compressors are needed to cover the extra solid waste 
attributable to the population increase. Landfill capacity has been exceeded by 19 percent; 91 percent 
of this exceeded capacity can be attributed to the Syria crisis. The gap between the landfill capacity and 
the total volume produced on daily basis is 812 and 886 ton per day in the North and Middle regions 
respectively.

Food Subsidies

The impact of the crisis on food subsidies is explained in the table below: -(based on figures received from 
the Ministry of Industry and Trade)

The impact of the crisis on food subsidies including wheat, barley and yeast during the period 2017-2019 is 
estimated at USD 38 million on average taking into consideration only out-of-camp Syrians. 

It is worth noting that there has been a significant increase in demand of some agricultural goods. As a 
result, many farmers who produced a surplus had benefited from an increased demand for their agricultural 
products in local markets. 

Income loss

The below table shows the income loss for the transport and labour sectors that will be attributable to 
the crisis between 2017 and 2019. Total land transport loss will be on average USD 42 million, including 
loss on the transport of goods (USD 26 million), general transport and tourism (USD 15.5 million), and 
railway transport (USD 386,000). In addition, the average loss of aviation can be estimated at around USD 
22 million. In total, average losses to the transport sector per year amount to USD 64 million.

In the labour sector, assuming that the number of employed Syrians with work permits increases by 15 
percent each year, the potential income loss from work permit fees is estimated at USD 40 million on 
average per year.

In addition, there are a number of positive impacts as a result of the Syria Crisis on Jordan’s economy such 
as: 

..Refugees can provide cheap labour in sectors such as agriculture, construction, housekeeping, and 
catering.
..Increasing local vendors’ income from the sale of essential foodstuffs and other commodities
..The increase in the size of the local markets can boost business and trade activities conducted by 
both hosts and refugees. 
..Syrian refugees contribute to the economy directly by enlarging the labour force and indirectly by 
attracting foreign aid.
..Syrian refugees contribute to the economy by enlarging the labour force cost, mainly, through the 
informal sector.

4.3 INDIRECT IMPACT

The Syria crisis has impacted – both directly and indirectly – all aspects of life in Jordan, exacerbating the 
Kingdom’s socioeconomic vulnerabilities, security burdens and environmental challenges, in addition to 
jeopardizing the developmental gains achieved over the past decades. As per the UNDP study entitled 
“Measuring the Indirect Impact of the Syrian Crisis on Jordan’s Economy,” which aimed to explain the effect 
of the Syrian crisis on the Jordanian economy have concluded that around USD 2 billion of this indirect 
impact are due to the effects of Syrian crisis on tourism receives, trade balance and capital fight.169 While 
around USD 1 to USD 1.5 billion is incurred implicitly by the economy due to hosting Syrian refugees in 
the country. If capital expenditures excluded from the calculation the total indirect impact will be equal 
to USD 3.1 billion. Given this, the indirect impact per refugee is estimated to range between USD 3000 to 
USD 3400.

4.4 DIRECT BUDGET SUPPORT NEEDS

Some of the effects of the crisis will be mitigated through the programmatic interventions identified in 
chapter 3. However, budgetary costs and income losses, which constitute a major burden on the economy, 
cannot be mitigated through the implementation of these interventions. Below are the major items/
sectors that require direct budget support to compensate for the additional costs and losses resulting from 
the Syria crisis.

5.1 GENERAL PRINCIPLES 

The JRP2017-19 is a genuine commitment of the Government of Jordan to put into practice the aid 
effectiveness and coordination principles that were established in the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid 
Effectiveness170 and reinforced subsequently in Accra171 in 2008 and Busan172 in 2011 as well as at the 
Third International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa in 2015. In particular, the 
JRP has been prepared under the overall supervision of the Government of Jordan represented by MoPIC 
(leadership), through the JRPSC and its Task Forces (ownership) and with the active participation of all 
relevant national and international stakeholders (inclusive participation) in order to ensure international 
community support to JRP national priorities (alignment and partnership). The JRP includes a full list of 
interventions with clear budget, activities and targets in order to facilitate the monitoring of its progress 
(results). It is a call for collective action to better support Syrian refugees as well as Jordanian people, 
communities and institutions affected by the crisis (mutual accountability and responsibility sharing).

The JRP2017-19 management arrangements have been set up in order to facilitate the smooth allocation 
and implementation of funding against JRP interventions. In particular, the Government’s overall process 
of project revision and approval will be streamlined by utilizing the same revision process for all projects. 
All implementing partners – government institutions, UN agencies, national and international NGOs, 
private sector – will have to upload their project information through JORISS, which will remain the only 
government-owned online project submission, tracking, and monitoring & reporting system for the JRP. 

If updated information is provided through JORISS, it will be possible for MOPIC to assure efficient targeting 
and prioritization, avoid duplications and gaps in response, provide policy and decision-makers with up-
to-date analysis on the evolving situation, and provide all relevant actors with the data they need to assess 
the effectiveness and impact of the actions that have been carried out.

5.2 APPROACH

The JRP 2017-19 is a three-year rolling plan. The recurring three-year planning cycle was adopted already 
last year (JRP2016-18) to provide a longer-term vision, facilitate the provision of multi-year financing and 
the supervision of multi-year interventions. Towards the end of 2017, the plan will be revised and another 
planning year will be added, turning the JRP 2017-19 into the JRP 2018-20. 

170) The Paris Declaration represents a joint undertaking on the part of the donor community and partner countries to make aid more effective. 
It involves a commitment by both parties to promote: (i) recipient-country ‘ownership’ of the development agenda; (ii) donor alignment with both 
the priorities and goals set by partner countries as well as an increased reliance on national administration systems; and (iii) more coordinated, 
streamlined and harmonised actions among multiple donors. As well as the core building blocks of ownership, alignment and harmonisation, the 
Paris Declaration also has two crosscutting concepts: mutual accountability and an emphasis on management-for-results.

171) The Accra Agenda for Action further strengthens and deepens the implementation of the Paris Declaration

172) The Busan Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation is a framework for continued dialogue and efforts to enhance the effectiveness 
of development co-operation.

CHAPTER FIVE

MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS



Under the overall coordination of MOPIC/HRCU and the JRPSC Secretariat, line ministries and Task 
Forces will be required to reassess sectoral vulnerabilities, needs and to re-prioritize projects within each 
sector based on achievements, implementation capacity and changes in circumstances. Partly funded 
interventions and unfunded interventions will be revised to assess their continued relevance and will be 
reprogrammed accordingly. The half-year report mentioned in the monitoring and reporting section will 
also be an important tool to assess JRP progress and re-consider needs and priorities.

5.3 Aid Modalities

Aid modalities are broad approaches that should be tailored closely to the context and situation in order 
to match aid resources with country’s needs and ownership.173 While the latest international aid principles 
call for an increase in budget support and other programme-based approaches, the Government of Jordan 
believes that assistance to the JRP should be made in a wide variety of ways involving different sets of 
relationships, responsibilities, and flows of resources, such as: 

..Budget support: a form of financial aid to channel donor funds directly to the government’s budget, 
using the government’s own allocation and accounting systems. The government encourages donors 
to place funds at its general disposal to support the mounting fiscal deficit and income losses incurred 
as a result of the Syria crisis. 
..Pooled funds: a form of aid that aims to reduce the transaction costs of aid for Jordan by channelling 
finance from multiple donors through one instrument.
..Project aid: a form of aid to finance specific activities with a limited objective, budget and timeframe 
to achieve specific results. Here, objectives require inputs to be linked to outputs. The project approach 
is based on the identification of a specific area of intervention for donor involvement, and the targeted 
use of funds for specific activities for which the objectives, outputs and inputs required to achieve 
them have been defined.


5.4 IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS

The implementation of JRP projects is open to any partner – government institutions, UN organizations, 
national and international NGOs, private sector, international cooperation agencies, development banks – 
that is registered in the country. 174 

All projects to be implemented in the framework of the JRP will have to be uploaded on JORISS, which 
centralizes all financial and technical project information and allows MOPIC to track activities and funding by 
sector, implementing partner, donor and geographical location. In this sense, JORISS is a tool to strengthen 
Government of Jordan’s capacity to monitor JRP results, thereby increasing overall transparency. 

To further reduce the risks of duplication and overlap, donors are encouraged to engage in early 
consultation with MOPIC regarding sectors and projects of interest to be financed. Also, it is requested that 
implementing partners coordinate closely with the relevant line ministry(ies) to make sure they are well 
informed about the project details.

5.5 PROJECT SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL

Once uploaded on to JORISS, projects are reviewed and cleared electronically by MOPIC and then submitted 
to the Inter-Ministerial Coordination Committee (IMCC) for approval before going to the Cabinet for final 
approval. The specifics of the process are as follows:

..MOPIC/HRCU will review each submitted project making sure that all required documents and

174) Implementing partners are highly encouraged to coordinate closely with the relevant line ministry(ies) at an early stage to ensure smooth 
approval.



information are included in the application, that it is aligned with the JRP objectives and that it does 
not duplicate with any project already under implementation. 

..IMCC will review the project to ensure it is in conformity with national laws, policies, norms and 
regulations. It also checks implementing partner’s capacity to achieve the intended desired results as 
well as the project management governance structure proposed, ensuring it includes sufficient levels 
of management oversight, quality assurance, risk management, realism and implementation capacity, 
an appropriate level of engagement with the relevant line ministry and appropriate and balanced 
finance of components, sectors and subject matters.
..Once approved by the IMCC, the project will be sent to Cabinet for final approval. 
..In instances where projects fall short of the quality required through the detailed project appraisal 
process outlined above, or where some aspect of the project appears to be conspicuously lacking, 
feedback will be provided to the applicant through JORISS advising what elements of the project 
document should be addressed prior to its re-submission.


5.6 MONITORING AND REPORTING

Monitoring of projects funded under the JRP2017-19 will be performed by the implementing entity 
according to the project document arrangements. However all implementing partners are requested to 
report back to MOPIC through JORISS on their project progress on a half year basis. 

Sector progress monitoring against set targets is expected to be an on-going responsibility of each line 
ministry and Task Force. The Task Force Chair, supported by the Task Force Secretariat, will endeavour to 
ensure that information is collected against JRP 2017-19 targets. It will also compile information from all 
implementing partners on main achievements and challenges for the reporting period. As JRP activities 
are increasingly funded and implemented, it is intended that the reports will evolve towards a results-
oriented format, in order help identify bottlenecks and priorities. This will happen commensurately with 
the strengthening of capacity within the Task Forces. 

Monitoring of funding flows to the JRP 2017-19 will be made through JORISS, allowing MOPIC and JRP 
stakeholders to sort financial information by donor, response type, sector and geographical location. 

5.7 MANAGEMENT SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS

JRP implementation is under the overall responsibility of MOPIC/HRCU with specific sector responsibilities 
lying on the relevant line ministries. The JRPSC Secretariat will continue supporting and building capacity 
within MOPIC and line ministries to provide overall strategic guidance and supervision to the JRP. The 
technical and policy advisory capacity of MOPIC will need to be further strengthened to enable it to 
gradually take the overall JRP coordination over from the JRPSC. Within line ministries, capacities will need 
to be reinforced to ensure that they have the capacity to lead their sector-wide multi-stakeholder analysis 
and planning. This entails fostering capacities to devise sector response strategies that are cost-effective 
and support the integration of humanitarian, recovery and development assistance.

To respond to the above needs, the existing management support structure should be maintained to 
provide the required support to MOPIC and line ministries to perform the functions requested by the JRPSC 
in order to effectively respond to the effects of the Syria crisis on the country.
