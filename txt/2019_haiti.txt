The Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) has shown that nearly 2.6 million people are extremely vulnerable and will need humanitarian assistance in 2019 as they have been affected by at least one crisis (hurricane, earthquake, drought, population displacement, cholera, malaria and diphtheria) in recent years. These multiple shocks have weakened the ability of the most vulnerable people to meet their basic needs and have had a negative impact on access to basic services, requiring increased humanitarian assistance. 
Humanitarian needs in Haiti are generated by these recurrent crises and aggravating structural factors. The country’s deterio- rated general context has not allowed significant progress to be made in reducing humanitarian emergencies, but on the contra- ry, it is a setback. The year 2018 was marked by a particularly difficult economic, political and social context characterized by growing instability and fragility. Social movements against the rise in the cost of living and protests against governance affected the country throughout the year and in particular in July 2018 following the increase in the price of petroleum products among other products that rose between 38% and 51%.1 The price of the basic food basket increased by 3% between the first and second quarters of 2018, and by 8% compared to the second quarters of 2018 and 2017. The depreciation of the Haitian gourde (HTG) against the US dollar (US$), as well as the increase in inflation throughout 2018, also had a significant impact on the purchasing power of Haitian households. The preparatory work and the workshop of the HNO made it possible to highlight 4 main themes around which to better understand the articulation and evolution of humanitarian needs, and the consequent responses to be provided. 
The analysis conducted by humanitarian actors of the link between the vital needs of populations and successive shocks suffered by Haiti shows that several sectors are regularly im- pacted and their progress undermined by the cyclical repetition of crisis or shock situations, the first of which are the natural hazards that have occurred in recent years. 
The terrible earthquake of January 2010 and the more moderate one of October 2018 had a profound impact on the country, with after-effects that are still visible today, including 37,500 people still in camps for displaced people since 2010 awaiting durable solutions, and 157,000 people affected by the last earthquake in the Nord-Ouest, Nord and Artibonite departments for whom medium-term assistance remains to be provided. 
The terrible earthquake of January 2010 and the more moderate one of October 2018 had a profound impact on the country, with after-effects that are still visible today, including 37,500 people still in camps for displaced people since 2010 awaiting durable solutions, and 157,000 people affected by the last earthquake in the Nord-Ouest, Nord and Artibonite departments for whom medium-term assistance remains to be provided. 
In addition to the seismic risk, there are hydro-meteorological risks, in particular hurricanes whose seasonality extends from June to the end of November. Thus, in October 2016, the de- partments of Sud, Grand’Anse, Nippes, Nord-Ouest and Gonâve Island (Ouest department) were hit by category 4 hurricane Mat- thew 4. The damage and losses due to the hurricane amounted to nearly $2.8 billion2 and affected nearly 2.1 million people, in- cluding 1.4 million people who needed emergency humanitarian assistance.3 There are still significant needs today, particularly in terms of shelter for populations affected by Hurricane Matthew, and more recently for those affected by the earthquake of last October. The Shelter/NFI sector estimates that nearly 494,000 people will need shelter assistance in 2019, particularly in rural and hard-to-reach areas of Nippes, Sud, Grand’Anse and Grand Nord departments. The Education sector estimated that nearly 100,000 students in departments affected by Hurricane Mat- 

PART I: CRISIS OVERVIEW 
CRISIS OVERVIEW 
In 2019, more than 2.6 million people in Haiti will need assistance, including 1.3 million people targeted by the Humanitarian Response Plan. In a context of economic fragility and socio-political tensions, the successive shocks that have affected the country (including natural disasters, epidemics, population displacements), combined with structural weaknesses limiting access to basic services, have considerably increased the chronic vulnerability of the Haitian population and reduced its capacity for resilience. 

Food insecurity and malnutrition, health emergencies, protection risks and population movements increase the vulnerability of mil- lions of Haitians already facing low local development and poverty. 
VITAL NEEDS ARISING FROM A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS RESULTING IN LOSS OF ACCESS TO BASIC SERVICES

PART I: CRISIS OVERVIEW 
thew still need support in school kits and teaching materials, while 23,000 students affected by the October earthquake need temporary learning spaces. 
In 2018, drought also returned to Haiti after the periods of 2015 and 2016, when it caused crop losses of more than 50%. While the autumn 2017 growing season had produced encouraging results for food security, the spring and summer 2018 growing seasons were severely disrupted by the lack of rainfall in several areas of the country. According to the results of the IPC analysis carried out by Haiti’s National Food Security Coordination (CNSA) in October and December 2018, it is estimated that for the projec- ted period from March to May 2019 more than 2.6 million people will be food insecure, including 571,000 in emergency situations (IPC phase 4) and will need food assistance. Nearly 2 million people will be in crisis (IPC Phase 3) and will require support to restore their drought-affected livelihoods. The departments with the highest proportion of people in crisis and emergency situations are the Nord, Nord-Est, Sud-Est, Centre, Nord-Ouest, Grand’Anse and Ouest.4 Compared to data from 2018, the number of food-insecure people doubled from 1.3 to 2.6 million. 
For the Nutrition sector, it is estimated that 39,000 children under five living in areas affected by the drought that struck in 2018 will require care in 2019 to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality associated with malnutrition, including 26,000 children at risk of developing moderate acute malnutrition and 13,000 suffering from severe acute malnutrition.5 Access to safe drinking water for more than 10,500 households, some of which have acutely mal- nourished children, is also essential to break the chain between water-related diseases and acute malnutrition. 
With regard to the Protection sector, it is estimated that more than 79,000 returnees will require specific care, including 17,000 children of Haitian origin who have been voluntarily returned or deported by the authorities of the Dominican Republic and will need to be reintegrated into the Haitian school system, as well as 12,000 people of Haitian origin who have also returned under the same conditions, who will need access to drinking water in temporary shelters and/or in communities of origin. 
STRENGTHEN PREPAREDNESS FOR NATURAL DISASTERS 
Ranked as the most vulnerable country in the Latin American and Caribbean region and the 14th most vulnerable country in the world,6 Haiti is considerably exposed to hydro-meteoro- logical and seismic shocks with severe humanitarian conse- quences. The entire country is at risk, especially urban centres, floodplains, coastal areas and areas near the tectonic fault line up right to the High North. In particular, the departments 
of Artibonite, Centre, Grand’Anse, Nippes, Nord-Est, Ouest, Sud and Sud-Est are the most at risk of being affected by natural di- sasters of major severity (-3) and critical severity (-4) on a scale from 0 to 5. More than 568,000 people live in these areas7 (this number served as a baseline for sectors to define their number of people in need of emergency preparedness measures; see HNO for more details). 
Risk and disaster management is organized around several entities, SNGRD, CNGRD and DPC, (under the supervision of the Ministry of the Interior) and supported by the Haitian Red Cross. The CNGRD (National Risk and Disaster Management Committee) is the inter-ministerial structure that oversees the SNGRD (National Risk and Disaster Management System), which is responsible for the «direction, coordination and eva- luation» of the implementation of programmes and activities provided for in the National Risk and Disaster Management Plan (PNGRD). The executive secretariat of the CNGRD is provided by the Directorate of Civil Protection (DPC), which was set up in 1997 and given the role of coordinating emergency operations following a disaster with the support of the Red Cross, State institutions, community organizations and civil society involved in the prevention and management of risks and disasters, but also humanitarian partners and donors. 
The DPC has a COUN (National Emergency Operations Centre) and COUDs (Departmental Emergency Operations Centre) and COUCs (Communal Emergency Operations Centre) in the regions but does not have an adequate budget; it is confronted with enormous operating difficulties that hinder its ability to cope with emergency situations under its control. An act to address these constraints and amend its current status has been tabled in Parliament and is awaiting approval or revision. 
The 11 COUDs and COUCs have an immediate need to be equip- ped with telecommunications and logistics equipment, to have an operating budget, a risk and disaster management plan, and coordination capacities according to a clearly defined plan. 
In this context, and in continuity with the efforts already made in 20188 by all partners, strengthening disaster preparedness will be an essential pillar of the humanitarian response plan around preparedness activities such as: the pre-positioning of contingency stocks in strategic departments; the availability of contingency agreements with financial service providers and mobile telephone operators for cash transfer terms; the development of sectoral contingency plans and their harmoni- sation with contingency plans (national and departmental); the construction/rehabilitation of temporary shelters to acceptable standards in areas most at risk; awareness-raising and support for at-risk populations and the most vulnerable communities (compliance with building standards, strengthening the food and nutrition surveillance system, agricultural recovery, resi-

EPIDEMIC CONTROL 
While the fight against the cholera epidemic that has persisted in Haiti since 2010 has shown encouraging results, diphtheria and malaria epidemics that have spread since 2014 and 2003 respectively have increased sharply in recent years.9 The Cho- lera and Health sectors have estimated that more than 333,000 people will be affected by the cholera epidemic (including about 4,400 infected) and about 31,000 people will be infected by di- phtheria and malaria epidemics. The departments of Artibonite, Centre and Ouest are the most affected by cholera and diphthe- ria, and the departments of Sud and Grand’Anse by malaria. 
The need for detection, confirmation and investigation, and for appropriate and community-based medical management of cholera, diphtheria and malaria cases, persists in almost all affected departments of the country. The epidemiological and laboratory surveillance, medical care and community early warning and response system that are in place and have proven their effectiveness will need to be maintained in 2019 in order to stop the transmission of cholera, malaria and diphtheria and 
save lives. In addition, vaccinations against cholera and diphthe- ria will need to be carried out in outbreak areas, and access to water, hygiene and sanitation, which are essential complements to the fight against epidemics, will need to be strengthened in areas at risk of cholera and malaria. 
The Haitian government and humanitarian partners are engaged in the fight against these three potentially epidemic diseases with the objective of working towards their elimination by 2022. This has resulted in the development of the National Cholera Elimination Plan 2013-2022 (PNEC) and the National Strate- gic Plan for Malaria Elimination 2016-2022. The PNEC was developed by the Ministry of Public Health and Population, in collaboration with partners, to move towards a sustainable res- ponse by addressing the problem of cholera elimination in three phases: short, medium and long term and by working on four axes: Water and Sanitation, Epidemiological Surveillance, Health Promotion for Behaviour Change and Care of Infected Persons in Health Institutions. Phase II or medium term of the PNEC is the current phase in progress (2016- 2018). 
In 2013, a malaria elimination feasibility study was conducted to support the efforts of the governments of the Republic of Haiti and the Dominican Republic in their joint goal of eliminating malaria from the island. It confirmed that if certain prerequisites are in place, this disease could be eliminated from Hispanio- la by 2020. Also, by endorsing the recommendations of this

report, the Haitian government has developed a strategic plan 2016 - 2022 that guides interventions, with the objectives of reducing malaria mortality to zero, achieving a break in local transmission by 2020, and maintaining and strengthening gains until 2022. The explosion in the number of people infected over the past two years suggests that the objective is still far off and that major efforts are needed. Therefore, the Humanitarian Response Plan considered, alongside cholera, the importance of starting the fight against malaria, but also against diphtheria, which is also experiencing a phase of worsening in terms of number of cases. 
STRENGTHENING PROTECTION 
Communities most affected by humanitarian crises are also the most vulnerable to protection risks. Approximately 465,000 people are particularly vulnerable to abuse, physical and sexual violence, exploitation and marginalization by the community. According to the 2016-17 EMMUS VI survey, nearly 29 per cent of women aged 15-49 have experienced physical violence since the age of 15, and 10.5 per cent of them in the 12 months preceding the survey.10 37,500 people are still displaced since the 2010 earthquake. On the other hand, the phenomenon of children involved in unacceptable forms of domestic work re- mains a concern. According to estimates made in recent years, 
the numbers of child domestic workers range from 170,000 to 400,000 children.11 In total, one in five children do not live with a biological parent.12 The breakdown of ties with the nuclear and/ or extended family exposes Haitians of all ages and genders to a greater risk of protection. 
Specifically, vulnerable persons still internally displaced since the 2010 earthquake, people of Haitian origin who have volun- tarily/spontaneously returned to Haiti or been deported by the Dominican authorities, persons at risk of statelessness and vic- tims of trafficking, separated or unaccompanied children, GBV survivors, people living with disabilities and highly marginalized populations including LGBT persons, people living with HIV/ AIDS and sex workers, are people in urgent need of protection. 
The protection of the fundamental human rights of the most vulnerable, in particular within the framework of the Protection Strategy developed under the aegis of the Protection Group and validated by the HCT+ and the OPC13 in November 2018, needs to be promoted and strengthened in 2019, in particular through access to minimum standards of care by psychosocial, legal and medical services, and reintegration of victims and survivors, but also by providing support to public institutions, community and civil society organizations with a protection mandate, in the implementation of measures to strengthen protection.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
In 2019-2020, the humanitarian community in Haiti acquires a multi-year strategic framework to address the vital needs of vulnerable people affected by a crisis, strengthen disaster preparedness, contribute to the elimination of diseases with epidemic potential, and promote the protection of fundamental human rights of the most vulnerable.

PART I: RESPONSE STRATEGY 
RESPONSE STRATEGY 
In 2019, the humanitarian community in Haiti is requesting US$ 126.2 million to meet the most urgent needs of 1.3 million affected people. The main objective of the humanitarian response strategy is to save lives, address the priority needs of the most vulnerable populations, and strengthen preparedness and mitigation measures for future shocks. 

The Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) for Haiti is based on the HNO 2019 humanitarian needs analysis, which estimates that 2.6 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in the country. The plan targets 1.3 million affected people for a multisectoral response that prioritises the most urgent needs identified in the HNO, in the Food Security, Health, Nutrition, WASH, Education, Shelter/NFI and Protection sectors. 
Compared to 2017 and 2018, the estimated number of people in need remains high due to the worrying food insecurity situation in the country, which is likely to worsen significantly in 2019. It should be stressed that the decrease in the number of people tar- geted in 2019 is not a sign of an improvement in the humanitarian situation but is justified by the various sectors’ effort to priori- tize in order to better identify and cover the needs of the most vulnerable, allowing the various stakeholders, including donors, to immediately identify the most urgent actions to be supported. 
As part of this 2019-2020 Humanitarian Response Plan, the Hu- manitarian Country Team (HCT) has developed both a multi-year and a thematic strategy to encourage a multisectoral approach to the vital needs of the most vulnerable affected by crises, epidemics, emergency preparedness and protection needs in the humanitarian response. This two-year approach aims to contribute to fostering linkage and complementarity with the ac- tions of development actors, while focusing on the most urgent and essential needs of the most vulnerable populations and the front-line response. 
The multisectoral approach of the 2019-2020 Humanitarian Response Plan is also reinforced by the effort to align with Haiti’s Strategic Development Plan – Emerging Country in 2030 (PSDH) and the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) in support of Haiti 2017-2021. The latter had already taken into account the contribution of humanitarian actors in achieving national development priorities. Indeed, UNDAF considers the humanitarian response as a cross-cutting theme that is integrated into the key interventions relating to the different priority areas of the United Nations and their respective effects. Thus, HRP 2019-2020 will contribute to the achieve- ment of outcomes in four UNDAF 2017-2021 priority interven- 
tion areas that overlap with the strategic objectives of the plan, including poverty reduction, access to and use of basic social services, protection and resilience.15 
Given Haiti’s fragility, disaster preparedness is an essential strategic focus of the HRP. All sectors have included disaster preparedness and response in their strategy, which will allow both a cross-cutting approach and multisectoral projects including support to the national risk and disaster management system (SNGRD), capacity building of government institutions and the Civil Protection Directorate (DPC) for the coordination of evaluations and joint responses. 
In this respect, the project approach with a multisectoral dimen- sion was encouraged, in order to promote optimized assistance actions that are more in line with the holistic needs of the targeted vulnerable people. The Protection and CCCM sectors have adopted a response strategy16 based on joint targeting to address the specific needs of those still displaced in the camps. In implementing the 2019-2020 HRP, humanitarian actors will take into account the centrality of Protection, the gender-sensi- tive approach, communication with communities, accountability and the cash transfer approach. All activities will ensure the safety, dignity and equitable access of beneficiary girls, women, boys and men to humanitarian assistance based on standard humanitarian principles and norms. 
THE CENTRALITY OF PROTECTION IN THE HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE 
The issue of protection of affected or threatened persons must guide decision-making and humanitarian response. Humanitarian actors must develop their information collection, management and analysis activities to inform and adapt preparedness and response activities, participate in the coordinated and strategic implementation of advocacy activities, promote dialogue and support humanitarian negotiations on behalf of affected or threatened populations, in order to reduce the risks to which they are exposed in emergencies. In all actions undertaken, humanitarian actors

must pay particular attention to meeting the expectations of affected populations by seeking to know, understand and support the protection measures in place. All affected populations should be involved in decisions and actions that have a direct impact on their well-being. 
Protection is a collective responsibility that cannot be limited exclusively to “protection» actors. Consequently, placing protection at the centre of humanitarian concerns requires that, from the outset of the crisis, humanitarian actors work with communities to identify cases of protection and ensure that protection measures are effectively taken into account throughout the programming cycle, paying particular attention to certain activities such as cash transfers that require the integration of protection standards to minimize possible community tensions. 
In the Haitian context, this implies that the protective environment must be strengthened through the implementation of appropriate actions that consider the identified needs of the affected populations in order to address protection risks. However, the achievement of this objective in Haiti is hampered by two factors: the lack of a common methodology to identify the most vulnerable communities and individuals and the absence of a harmonized mechanism to report complaints related to the humanitarian response. The most vulnerable are often voiceless and the most difficult to reach or identify. The implementation of these tools will allow humanitarian actors to more effectively prioritize assistance to people whose lives are threatened by a humanitarian crisis. 
THE DISTINCT NEEDS OF THE TWO SEXES THROUGH A GENDER MAINSTREAMING APPROACH 
The humanitarian needs analysis informs us that natural disasters, socio-economic conditions, epidemics, and crises of all kinds affect women and men, girls and boys in different ways. Pre-existing gender inequalities are aggravating factors and increase vulnerabilities for the most vulnerable and marginalized groups. A UNFPA evaluation report17 published four months after hurricane Matthew estimated that, of the approximately 2.1 million people affected by the disaster, 546,000 women and girls of childbearing age and more than 500,000 young people and adolescents aged 10 to 24 had urgent needs, such as the need to reduce multiple risks of unsafe deliveries, unwanted pregnancies, transmission of sexually transmitted infections and sexual violence that significantly challenged their rights (rights to health, human dignity and so on) in the face of a deeply weakened health system. This is particularly important for adolescent girls who are more exposed to forced sex, early and forced marriage and motherhood, increased risk-taking associated with gender 
roles in family circles and reduced availability of adolescent sexual and reproductive health services.18 On the other hand, the Government’s 2016 needs assessment report (PDNA)19 identified that, in addition to urgent humanitarian assistance needs, women in the South Peninsule have experienced losses of seeds and livestock, increasing their risk of food insecurity and weakening the household’s resilience capacity. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, about 22% of those who work the land are women. Aware of these challenges and the need to integrate gender considerations into their programming, humanitarian actors conducted a comparative analysis of the 2015 population data of the Haitian Institute of Statistics and Informatics (IHSI) in the HNO20, disaggregated into two age groups (under 18 and over 18), and a complementary disaggregation was carried out based on the 2013 Haiti Reference Study to integrate the over 59 age group.21 Relevant cultural factors that regulate the relationships between different gender and age groups have been taken into account. Partners therefore ensure that projects attached to the Humanitarian Response Plan 2019-2020 are built on gender-sensitive analysis and ensure that the distinct needs of all gender and age categories are considered in assistance and protection. Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms should analyse whether the different affected population groups have had equitable access to protection and humanitarian services, through the analysis of data disaggregated by gender and age group. A GenCap expert to support the Country Team in Haiti supports the implementation of the Humanitarian Response Plan. He will be able to conduct additional and in-depth gender needs analyses at the sectoral level, based on gender and age disaggregated data, to inform and guide decisions on interventions to be implemented, and preferred monitoring methods, based on applicable strategic guidance documents. In addition, training will be organized for sector members to strengthen their capacity in gender-sensitive programming and the acquisition of tools that facilitate the integration of a gender perspective into their interventions. The use of the IASC’s new gender and age marker will also help to forge a solid reflection on the relevant elements of good programming that integrates certain fundamentals, including the influence of beneficiary populations in all phases of programmes, accountability to them and their level of satisfaction with the benefits achieved by each gender and age group. The participation of people assisted in identifying their needs and in the different phases of interventions is an important aspect of respect for their dignity, and gender mainstreaming contributes to this.

an essential component in humanitarian work, programme implementation and ownership. Several post-disaster evaluations22 have identified significant weaknesses in the approach to communicating with aid recipients. The deployment of a special advisor in community communications during the response to hurricane Matthew in 2016 enabled the HCT and the Directorate of Civil Protection to develop a strategy for coordinating communication with affected populations, which was however only poorly implemented due to a lack of monitoring and resources. Dialogue sessions in June 2017 between humanitarian actors and local authorities represented by mayors of municipalities, deputy mayors and decentralized state services also fostered a greater common understanding and analysis of emergency situations, but failed to establish sufficiently sustainable communication and feedback systems. During the SIMEX in 2018, and the earthquake of last October, these same difficulties partially reappeared, recalling the need to maintain ongoing efforts to contribute to the implementation of a more functional coordination and communication system. However, based on the results of the recent Ground Truth Solutions (GTS) survey on the perception of humanitarian assistance in Haiti by affected communities, significant progress has been made compared to 2017 data. The percentage of affected people feeling treated with respect by humanitarian actors has risen from 27% in 2017 to 85% in 2018, and while only 5% of respondents believed in 2017 that their opinions were taken into account by humanitarian actors, by 2018 this proportion had risen to 34%. On the other hand, the perception of commitment to information sharing has changed little, from 31% to 40%. In addition, 85% of those surveyed do not know how to make suggestions or complaints to humanitarian agencies, and 75% believe that if they make a complaint or suggestion, they will not receive a response. 60% of respondents do not feel informed in a timely manner about the assistance available to them and 55% of the sample indicated that they do not understand the targeting criteria. In view of these results, the humanitarian community commits itself in HRP 2019-2020 to promote and encourage, through concrete actions, collective responsibility and greater community engagement in the programming and delivery of aid. One of these actions will be the implementation of a communication mechanism with the communities, integrated into the Complaint, Referral and Feedback Mechanism currently being developed by the Protection sector. The humanitarian community will also ensure that affected communities actively participate in decision-making processes that affect them, and ensure that the most marginalized affected people are represented in order to have a significant impact. The results collected by Ground Truth Solutions will serve as initial benchmarks for the formulation of guidelines by the Humanitarian Country Team to 1) ensure greater community 
engagement in aid programming and delivery during the next humanitarian cycle and 2) ensure progress against IASC commitments.23 
USE OF CASH TRANSFERS In line with the commitments of the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit, the humanitarian community in Haiti is committed through the CBTWG (Cash-based Transfers Working Group) to increase cash programming as a flexible and effective way to support affected people while respecting their dignity and reducing their dependence on aid. Thus, scaling up monetary assistance in three of the four themes selected in this Humanitarian Response Plan must be a common objective. Monetary assistance is indeed a central element of humanitarian response planning to ensure access to basic needs (HRP Theme 1). As such, the use of multiple-use cash transfers, by their non-restrictive nature, allows for a broader coverage of needs and places beneficiaries at the centre of interventions. Cash transfers can also be used to pursue sectoral objectives, including those related to food security – recognizing that these can only be achieved in a sustainable manner if livelihoods, access to safe drinking water, minimum hygiene standards, basic education and basic health concerns are taken into account at the same time. In addition, market analysis and monitoring are an essential prerequisite for any monetary intervention, particularly to assess their ability to provide basic goods and services to the affected population. Finally, it should be recalled that cash transfers are not necessarily a substitute for in-kind assistance and can be used to complement it. Cash transfers can also play a major role in emergency response and natural disaster preparedness (HRP Theme 2). As such, pre-crisis market analyses (PCMA) will be conducted in 2019, prior to the hurricane season, to improve the quality of interventions benefiting vulnerable people in the event of a crisis. The Haiti-specific emergency technical transfer guide will be strengthened and updated to provide humanitarian actors with common analytical and response tools for appropriate and quality monetary programming in an emergency situation. Finally, the protection of vulnerable populations must be fully integrated into the framework of monetary interventions (HRP Theme 4). CBTWG members will be trained in particular on the prevention of abuse, violence, exploitation and exclusion of those identified as most vulnerable. In addition, the integration of protection into monetary assistance should be done through the inclusion of affected populations as participants in all phases of the project, not just as beneficiaries. Risks and benefits in protecting individuals, households and communities will be identified, including by considering age, gender and diversity dimensions at all stages of individual projects – standardized assessments for species interventions can be adapted, for

PART I: STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
ARTICULATION OF THE HUMANITARIAN – DEVELOPMENT NEXUS CRanked 168th out of 189 countries assessed according to the Human Development Index (HDI 2018), Haiti suffers from significant structural and interconnected weaknesses. The 2018 Humanitarian Needs Analysis (HNO) confirmed that humanitarian needs in Haiti are symptoms of deeper and chronic development problems, linked to extreme poverty and deprivation in all areas including basic needs, low human development, and gender inequality. The resilience capacities of households affected by successive shocks have thus further declined, with many households unable to fully recover from the impact of previous disasters, while durable solutions for affected and most vulnerable households still need to be put in place to break the cycle of prolonged needs and recurring crises. Fully aware of the limitations that humanitarian action alone can have in addressing these underlying causes of vulnerability, the humanitarian community continues to advocate for investments to support both «urgent actions» addressing acute and immediate needs, and «important actions» to strengthen long-term resilience and promote sustainable development. It is in this sense that a working group was set up in 2018 to move forward on the path of Nexus and propose optimised strategies to strengthen the link and the necessary complementarity between humanitarian and development. In the Haitian context, the choice of common themes for which to define joint objectives and results to be achieved together is already being implemented with the cholera approach, and the HRP has chosen to promote emergency preparedness as a relevant opportunity for strengthened partnerships between development and humanitarian partners, with the support of donors, the private sector and the relevant government services. In particular, support for the DPC’s central and decentralised services, which are the key actors in disaster preparedness and initial response coordination, is an essential focus of joint work. Other themes, in particular shelter, are also essential in Haiti and expect joint and complementary actions from all the actors involved, which alone can lead to significant progress and a continuous and sustainable reduction in needs. Reflection will continue in 2019-2020 to achieve greater interaction and effectiveness in reducing the dependency of vulnerable populations.
