FOREWORD BY

THE HUMANITARIAN 
COORDINATOR

Humanitarian needs in Cameroon have never been greater. Today, 
4.3 million people need humanitarian assistance, one in five, with 
women and children being the most vulnerable. An increase of 
more than 30% compared to 2018, which affects almost the entire 
Cameroonian territory (8 regions out of 10).

In the South-West and North-West in particular, we have witnessed 
the emergence of a new crisis characterized by numerous abuses and 
violations of human rights. More than half a million people have 
been displaced, civilians and basic facilities have been repeatedly 
targeted. The consequences on the education system, health and 
agricultural production are terrible. 

The crisis in the Far North, where nearly half a million people are 
still displaced, is also far from over. We are witnessing an upsurge in 
violence which has already forced 35,000 people to flee their villages 
in eastern Nigeria and find refuge in Cameroon. 

In the East, North and Adamaoua, the prospects for return for the 
252,000 Central African refugees are still slim. They too require our 
support and renewed efforts to promote their resilience within host 
communities. 

Three crises with different causes and impacts. Needs that range 
from immediate life-saving to protracted recovery. Response 
strategies that must be adapted and built around these different 
contexts and vulnerabilities.

Fortunately, the Cameroonian people continue to show enormous 
generosity in the face of humanitarian distress. Thousands of families 
in Makary, Amchidé or Limbé have opened their homes to those 
who have fled conflict, sharing already very limited resources. In 
difficult and sometimes hostile environments, humanitarian workers 
work tirelessly to provide assistance to those in need.

Humanitarian actors must have safe, sustainable and unhindered 
access to populations in need across the country. I therefore call on 
all to recognize the importance of the protection of civilians and to 
uphold humanitarian access. 

Protection, food security, access to health care, education and other 
basic services are our priority. We need $299 million to help the 2.3 
million most vulnerable women, girls, men and boys; a million more 
than in 2018. 

In 2019, affected populations in Cameroon remain our primary 
partner and we will ensure their participation to guide the planning 
and implementation of interventions, as well as the monitoring of 
the response. In this way, we wish to extend the existing networks 
of protection against sexual exploitation and abuse in Maroua and 
Yaoundé, to the North-West and South-West regions.

We will also continue to coordinate humanitarian activities with 
the Government of Cameroon, recognizing that the primary 
responsibility for the protection of populations lies with the 
Government. This means establishing timely coordination 
mechanisms and strengthening accountability, without duplication 
and in accordance with humanitarian principles. 

Our partnership with local actors, who are on the frontline of 
our relief efforts, will also be at the heart of our interventions and 
capacity building efforts.

Finally, I salute the generosity of our donors, without whom we 
could not help hundreds of thousands of people to survive and 
recover. Yet in 2018 the humanitarian response in Cameroon was 
the least funded in Africa. At the beginning of this year, I appeal to 
everyone to redouble their efforts and support our response plan for 
the people of Cameroon. A peaceful Cameroon, where no one is left 
behind, is not only essential for the country’s development, but also 
vital for the stability of the sub-region.

OVERVIEW OF

THE CRISIS

Cameroon is experiencing the impact of three distinct, complex humanitarian crises 
fuelled primarily by violence and insecurity. More than one in six people in Cameroon 
need humanitarian assistance, an increase of 31 per cent since 2018.

Today, eight out of ten regions in Cameroon are being impacted 
by three humanitarian and protection emergencies affecting the 
country, marking a sharp deterioration of the situation. More 
than one million people are living as refugees or IDPs, twice 
as much as one year ago, making Cameroon one of the fastest 
growing displacement crisis in Africa in 2018. 3 million people 
are food insecure. 222,000 children under five are suffering 
from acute malnutrition, including 60,000 with severe acute 
malnutrition. Over 1.5 million people are in need of emergency 
health assistance. 

The situation in the North-West and South-West is of 
particular concern where insecurity and attacks against 
civilians have forced over 437,000 people to flee across four 
regions, which now host 40 per cent of the total displaced 
population in Cameroon. In a context of insecurity, characterized 
by a climate of ‘terror’, the protection of civilians is particularly at 
risk. 

Children, and their basic right to education, are particularly 
vulnerable as a result of the ‘no school’ policy pursued by 
separatists non-state armed groups. 80 per cent of children are 
deprived of education, and only one in four completed the 2017-
2018 school year in the South-West. The ongoing conflict also 
continues to negatively impact access to basic health services. 
Out of 18 health districts in the North-West and South-West 
regions, 16 are considered unsafe for health personal and 40 
per cent of health facilities are no longer functional. More than 
70 per cent of the population identified agriculture as the main 
source of livelihoods before the crisis, making a high dependence 
on external assistance inevitable in the short term.

In the Lake Chad Basin, Cameroon is the second most affected 
country by the Boko Haram crisis. More than 50 per cent of 
people living in the Far North (1.9 million) need humanitarian 
assistance. The security situation in this region continues to 
deteriorate with an upsurge of violence reported in the last 
quarter of 2018. 445 civilians lost their lives in the conflict in 
2018, a dramatic increase compared to the 281 casualties of 2017. 
The resurgence of violence has led to additional displacements, 
especially in the second half of the year, with the number of 
IDPs, returnees and refugees out of camps increasing on average 
by 7 per cent. Newly displaced people in the Far North (both 
IDPs and Nigerian refugees) are highly vulnerable given the 
loss of property, limited access to services and general mistrust 
and stigmatization by community members on suspicion of 
collaboration and affiliation with non-state armed groups.

With half of the population under the age of 18 and poverty rates 
of 74 per cent, young people are more vulnerable and exposed 
to recruitment by non-state armed groups and other grave child 
rights violations. 

Cameroon is home to the largest number of Central African 
refugees, with 252,000 refugees, in the East and Adamaoua. 
Over 70 per cent of refugees live in host communities. With 
already high levels of poverty in the region (Adamaoua, 41.7 
per cent, and East, 30 per cent), the influx of CAR refugees has 
overstretched already limited basic services. Only 43 per cent of 
refugee girls attend school (compared to 67 per cent for refugee 
boys). Given the protracted nature of displacement – with most 
refugees arriving in 2014/2015 – investing in long-term, durable 
solutions for displaced people and sustainable development for 
the displaced as well as host communities will be essential.



2017- 2020 MULTI-YEAR HUMANITARIAN

RESPONSE STRATEGY

2.3 million people are targeted by this multi-year response plan, representing 
53 per cent of the 4.3 million people in need. This plan requires US $299 million 
to meet the most urgent needs in the prioritized regions.

This prioritization is based on cross-sectoral severity of 
needs; possible response modalities, including cash transfer 
programming; partners’ operational capacity; funding 
projections; access constraints; and complementarity with 
efforts deployed by the Government and development 
partners. 

As the nature and severity of needs vary across the three 
crises, programming and response modalities, including 
access and coordination mechanisms, will be tailored for 
these diverse needs. Each sector has therefore developed three 
distinct yet coherent strategies. For example, the education 
sector will work to enable access to a safe, quality education 
and safeguard the civilian nature of education facilities at a 
time of ongoing conflict in the North-West, South-West and 
the Far North. At the same time, the education sector will 
continue to work with the Ministry of Basic Education and 
development partners in the East, Adamaoua and North in 
order to include refugee education in national education 
sector planning. 

Humanitarian needs, including forced displacements, in 
Cameroon are directly attributed to conflict but aggravated by 
long-term structural deficits. This underlines the need to scale 
up medium/longer-term efforts, in parallel to humanitarian 
assistance, in order to strengthen resilience. Cameroon is 
one of the seven priority countries for the UN Joint Steering 
Committee on advancing humanitarian and development 
collaboration and has been actively implementing the 
New Way of Working (NWOW) since the 2016 World 
Humanitarian Summit. The NWOW, as conceptualized in 
this multi-year response plan, presents opportunities for 
a comprehensive approach that complements life-saving 
assistance with efforts to strengthen individual and systemic 
resilience, including the UNDAF (2018-2020) and the DSCE 
(2010-2020)1
1. Document de Stratégie pour la Croissance et l’Emploi (DSCE), Gouvernement 
du Cameroun, 2010-2020

 . In 2019, the humanitarian community will 
focus on identifying collective outcomes, together with the 
Government and development partners, to elicit increased 
and accelerated action for sustainable development, in 
accordance with humanitarian principles. 

Humanitarian access remains a key challenge for the 
humanitarian community, especially in the North-
West, South-West and the Far North, primarily due to 
the unpredictable security situation, ongoing conflict, 
international humanitarian law violations, and administrative 
impediments. In the North-West and South-West, more than 
50 per cent of the IDP population have sought refuge in rural 
areas, often inaccessible to humanitarian workers, which 
means that humanitarian actors are not able to independently 
and impartially assess their situation or provide them with 
aid. Non-discriminatory access of persons of concern to 
essential services, and access of humanitarian actors to those 
in need will remain priorities in 2019, in accordance with 
humanitarian principles and international humanitarian 
law. Civil-military engagement to facilitate and advocate 
for the movement of humanitarian actors and cargo will be 
essential in ensuring a principled humanitarian response. 
Humanitarian actors will strive to ensure more meaningful 
participation of affected populations into the response to 
increase acceptance among communities. 

In 2018, humanitarian partners have significantly scaled-up 
their presence and capacity, especially in the North-West and 
South-West: some 125 partners are part of the 2019 HRP, a 
56 per cent increase since 2018. Humanitarian presence and 
response have gradually increased in the North-West and 
South-West, with the activation of clusters and the set-up 
of a joint UN Office in South-West and one in North-West 
in the upcoming year. In 2019, capacity-building for local 
partners will be prioritised in order to facilitate the delivery 
of quality services and assistance, including in areas where 
local partners may enjoy enhanced access compared to 
international organisations. Meanwhile, response capacity will 
also need to be strengthened in the Far North, comprising 40 
per cent of the humanitarian needs, in order to respond to 
emerging needs, including those of returnees.

BUDGET (US$)

299M

The number of people estimated to be in need of 
humanitarian assistance has increased by 31 per cent 
compared to 2018, from 3.4 million to 4.3 million. 

The number of people who will be targeted for assistance has 
also increased from last year, from 1.3 million to 2.3 million. 
This increased is mainly attributed to emerging needs in the 
North-West and South-West regions. 

Financial requirements have remain similar to last year due to 
more realistic, credible and articulated costing methodologies, 
taking into account actors presence, access constraints and 
complementary non-humanitarian interventions. The food 
security sector budget remains the highest with US $ 60 
million required. The protection budget has almost doubled, 
reflecting growing human rights violations and protection 
risks. 

More than a quarter of people targeted by the response 
(28 per cent or 820,000 people) lives in the North-West 
and South-West regions, which are now priority areas of 
intervention. Sectors need US $ 93 million - or 31 per cent 
of the total appeal - to support 437,000 IDPs in these two 
regions, the West and Littoral, and 376,000 vulnerable host 
communities due to forced displacement and disruption of 
social and health services. 

Almost half of the people in need (1.9 million) are in the Far 
North, of which 880,000 will be targeted for aid, requesting 
122 million (40 per cent of the total appeal). 

The protracted crisis related to the arrival of Central African 
refugees will continue to mobilize US 81 million to provide 
multi-sectoral emergency and resilience assistance to 580,000 
Central African refugees and host communities.

DONATING THROUGH 
THE CENTRAL 
EMERGENCY 
RESPONSE FUND (CERF)

CERF provides rapid initial 
funding for life-saving actions 
at the onset of emergencies and 
for poorly funded, essential 
humanitarian operations in 
protracted crises. The OCHA-
managed CERF receives 
contributions from various 
donors – mainly governments, 
but also private companies, 
foundations, charities and 
individuals – which are 
combined into a single fund. 
This is used for crises anywhere 
in the world. Find out more 
about the CERF and how to 
donate by visiting the CERF 
website:

IN-KIND RELIEF AID

The United Nations urges donors to make cash rather than in-kind donations, for maximum speed and 
flexibility, and to ensure the aid materials that are most needed are the ones delivered. If you can make only 
in-kind contributions in response to disasters and emergencies, please contact:

logik@un.org

REGISTERING AND RECOGNIZING YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS 

OCHA manages the Financial Tracking Service (FTS), which records all reported humanitarian contributions 
(cash, in-kind, multilateral and bilateral) to emergencies. Its purpose is to give credit and visibility 
to donors for their generosity and to show the total amount of funding and expose gaps in humanitarian 
plans. Please report yours to FTS, either by email to fts@un.org or through the online contribution report 
form at http://fts.unocha.org
