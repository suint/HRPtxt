MOZAMBIQUE 

OVERVIEW OF THE CRISIS

Mozambique is facing significant pockets of severe food insecurity, mainly due 
to poor rainfall and the fall army worm (FAW) invasion, which have contributed 
to reduced crop production, particularly of maize. The drought is also causing 
increased levels of malnutrition, water scarcity and school drop-outs, as well as 
heightening the risk of communicable diseases and of exacerbating HIV rates.

Mozambique experiences natural hazards every year, 
particularly given its geographical location (the country 
is located downstream of nine international river basins and 
has a long Indian Ocean coastline with active cyclone activity) 
and the social and economic vulnerability of the population. 
Drought occurs primarily in the southern region, with a 
frequency of seven droughts every 10 years1
1. Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery https://www.gfdrr.org/mozambique

. The recurrence 
of these climatic shocks in shorter cycles has negated efforts 
to reduce vulnerability across many communities. 

The 2017-2018 rainy season was characterised by a 
late start, extended mid-season dry spell (December-
January) and heavy rains. Although the 2017-2018 rainy 
season performed better than the 2015-16 El Niño episode, 
the dry spell resulted in moisture stress and wilting of 
early planted crops in many areas. This has caused below 
average agricultural yield, particularly in southern and some 
central parts of Mozambique. Although the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Food Security affirms that there is enough 
food availability at the aggregate level, the country is facing 
significant pockets of food insecurity, mainly due to the poor 
rainfall performance and the fall army worm (FAW) invasion 
that contributed to reduced crop production, particularly of 
maize. According to the FAW early warning system (FAMEWS), 
the infestation level in Mozambique is estimated to be 
between 21 to 40 per cent and the high likelihood of an El 
Niño event could contribute to the multiplication of the pest, 
given its high reproductivity in dry conditions.

Climatic predictions for the 2018-2019 rainfall season 
indicate normal to below normal rainfall for the 
southern and central regions, and normal to above 
normal rainfall for the northern region, according to the 
National Institute for Meteorology (INAM). As of 3 December, 
the likelihood of an El Niño had been revised to at least 80 
per cent during the period between November 2018 to March 
2019, according to the official El Niño-Southern Oscillation 
(ENSO) forecast. This poses a high risk for the Mozambique 
2018-2019 cropping season, especially in already drought-
affected southern and parts of central regions. Households 
in these areas will likely be forced to plant multiple times 
after repeated attempts, resulting in crop failures, as well as 
depletion of household seed stocks. 

An estimated 814,700 people in five provinces are 
facing the most severe levels of food insecurity (IPC 
3 and above) and need life-saving assistance during 
the lean season. The most affected provinces are Cabo 
Delgado, Inhambane, Gaza, Sofala, and Tete. Gaza province, 
for example, has nearly 22 percent of its population – more 
than 318,000 people - affected by the crisis. Tete, Inhambane, 
Sofala and Cabo Delgado reported together almost 500,000 
people in IPC phase 3. This population is a prioritised subset 
of the overall number of severely food insecure people in 
11 provinces, which is estimated at 1.78 million people (IPC 
phase 3 and above) for the period of September to December 
2018, according to the Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) 
analysis and the food security and nutrition assessment 
conducted by the Technical Secretariat for Food Security and 
Nutrition (SETSAN) in October 2018. 

The impact of rising food insecurity is compounded by 
high levels of poverty, as well as the Government’s limited 
fiscal space to respond effectively. Despite a downward trend 
in the incidence of poverty over the years, the number of 
poor people remains high and inequality is growing. Almost 
half of the population (46.3 per cent) continues to be poor 
in monetary and non-monetary terms; with 84.9 per cent

. Recent poverty analysis conducted 
in Mozambique shows that cyclone, flood or drought can 
lead to a drop of up to 25 to 30 per cent in per capita food 
consumption and that affected households also cut back on 
expenditures in basic non-food items. 

Agricultural production is likely to diminish, particularly 
in areas where there is a risk of low rainfall and 
likelihood of increased incidence of pests and 
diseases. The rain-dependent agricultural sector, which 
accounts for around 25 per cent of Mozambique’s Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) and employs nearly 75 per cent of 
the labour force, is highly vulnerable to drought and other 
natural hazards, with an estimated loss of US$20 million per 
year, according to the World Bank3

. Nearly 94 per cent of the 
poor are primarily engaged in agriculture for their subsistence. 
Based on the initial analysis from the Ministry of Agriculture 
and Food Security (MASA), the crop water needs index is 
reportedly low in seven provinces, including in Inhambane 
and Gaza areas in the southern region. In the first quarter of 
2019, significant improvement is expected in the northern and 
central regions, with the exception of Tete province (reporting 
low index), while the southern region is expected to show 
between low and very low index, particularly in Inhambane 
and Gaza. There are already some indications in Gaza 
province of families reliant on small livestock moving to forest 
areas in search of green pasture and water, increasing the 
risk of conflict with wild animals. For December 2018 to April 
2019, the Technical Secretariat for Food and Nutrition Security 
(SETSAN) has prioritised 815,000 people in five provinces for 
immediate humanitarian assistance. For January to March 
2019, it is projected that the population in need will slightly 
reduce to 737,000 people, assuming that the crop water 
index will be adequate and a green harvest will take place in 
February 2019.

An estimated 19,500 children in nine districts are 
expected to suffer from Acute Malnutrition during 
the next six-month period, according to the IPC Acute 
Malnutrition analysis conducted in April 2018 by SETSAN. 
Five districts will be in IPC Acute Malnutrition (AMN) phase 
2 or above during the 2018-2019 lean season. Global Acute 
Malnutrition (GAM) is expected to increase from acceptable 
to alert/serious levels (IPC phase 2 and 3) with GAM rates 
between 6 to 10.9 per cent, particularly in Balama, Cabo 
Delgado, Marara in Tete province, Milange in Zambezia 
province and Macossa in Manica province, largely due to: low 
quality and quantity of infant feeding; increased occurrence 
of childhood diseases, such as diarrhoea and malaria; low 
coverage of health and sanitation services; and low access 
to safe water sources. Results from the SETSAN analysis 
have shown a critical food security and nutrition situation in 
five districts in the north of Cabo Delgado province linked to 
conflict and violence: Quissanga, Macomia, Mocimboa da 
Praia, Nangade and Palma.

Families are expected to adopt negative stress coping 
strategies in almost all of the affected provinces, 
heightening protection risks, particularly for women 
and children, according to preliminary indications in the 
October 2018 SETSAN report. The most severe cases are 
in Gaza, Inhambane and Sofala, where families are already 
adopting crisis strategies (17 per cent) and emergency 
strategies (13 per cent) respectively, including: selling of 
productive assets and animals; and taking children out of 
school to perform household chores, including fetching water, 
and begging. In the past – including during the 2015-2017 El 
Nino - rising food insecurity has heightened the risk of child 
labour, child trafficking and forced marriage. Past anecdotal 
evidence suggests that the age of sexual debut lowered to 11- 
or 12-years during drought, with older men engaging with girls 
aged 11 to 13 as they went about water collection activities.

Drought continues to negatively impact children’s 
well-being and their access to education, often leading 
to student absenteeism, poor concentration in class due to 
hunger and thirst, and ultimately contributing to a decrease 
in children’s learning outcomes. Shortage of water leads 
to migration of the most vulnerable rural families and 
consequently their children drop out of school.

Access to safe water is also a challenge, including 
due to drought.Only half of Mozambicans have access to 
improved water supply and only one in five use improved 
sanitation facilities. There is a large disparity between urban 
(80 per cent) and rural water supply coverage (35 per cent), 
and only an estimated 40 per cent of rural schools have 
water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities for learners 
and teachers. Unimproved sanitation has been linked to poor 
maternal health, with 90 per cent of underweight mothers 
having access to only unimproved sanitation4

. Diminished 
rainfall has heightened challenges to accessing safe water. 
The storage level of the Pequenos Libombos dam, located in 
Maputo province, was only 22.6 per cent as of 29 November 
2018. Pequenos Libombos dam supplies the cities of 
Maputo, Matola and Boane and has not been above 50 
per cent since the severe drought in 2016. However, water 
resources authorities expect that by March 2019 the storage 
level of the dam may increase and reach 50 per cent of its 
capacity, based on available forecasts. At the peak of the lean 
season in drought-affected areas it is expected that around 
296,000 people will need some form of WASH intervention, 
as localised water stress levels will impact the waiting time 
at water points as well as longer return distances for water 
trucking.

RESPONSE CAPACITY

The humanitarian response will be led and coordinated by 
the Government through the National Institute of Disaster 
Management (INGC) and related emergency coordination 
mechanisms. This will be supported by the Humanitarian 
Country Team (HCT) which is composed of UN agencies, 
International NGOs, Red Cross and donor representatives.

The Government has established three main bodies in 
the country to manage the disaster risk and emergency 
preparedness and response namely: 1) Coordination Council 
for Disaster Management (CCGC) - chaired by the Prime 
Minister and includes all Council of Ministers members 
from the sectors directly involved and affected in situations 
of natural disasters; 2) Technical Council for Disaster 
Management (CTGC) - chaired by INGC General Director and is 
composed by the National Directors from the relevant sectors 
usually affected by a disaster and 3) National Emergency 
Operative Centre (CENOE) - a multi-sector coordination 
and decision-making structure where representatives from 
different Government sectors, HCT and key stakeholders 
meet to ensure coordination and response planning. All these 
bodies are replicated at provincial and district levels. 

The HCT is supported at the more operational level by an 
Inter-cluster Coordination Group (ICCG). The interaction 
between the Government and partners during emergencies is 
done through CENOE within the existing four sectors, as well 
as through cluster meetings, where Government counterparts 
are invited to participate. There are 10 sectors, mostly led 
by UN agencies, which support the Government through line 
ministries and ensure coordination on disaster preparedness 
and response. The number of member organisations per 
sector varies between seven and twelve and they have 
presence in all affected provinces.

At provincial level, HCT focal points support and facilitate 
coordination with Provincial Government authorities. Some 
of the INGO partners are organised in consortiums and have 
the capacity to implement multiple activities across clusters/ 
sectors within the districts. 

Response to date

The Food Security sector is providing food assistance until 
April 2019 through both conditional and unconditional 
transfers programs using in-kind, vouchers or cash, 
depending on context and readiness of local markets. The 
main food security partners are the World Food Programme, 
assisting 220,000 people in the provinces of Gaza, Tete 
and Cabo Delgado, and the CHEMO consortium (12 NGOs, 
led by World Vision), assisting 80,000 people in Gaza and 
Inhambane. The Government is also providing assistance 
to affected people in Gaza, Tete and Manica provinces, 
mainly with food (103,500 people) and water (5,992 people). 
In addition, the WASH sector has developed a technical 
guideline on WASH in humanitarian assistance, finalized 
the standard hygiene kit contents in consultation with 
government partners and established procurement routes. 
The Protection sector is working on: a) dissemination of 
Protection and Gender Mainstreaming tools among other 
clusters; b) training of humanitarian field staff on cross-
cutting issues such as HIV and GBV; c) set-up of local social 
support services and actions for people with disabilities and 
other vulnerable people; d) preparation for the roll out of 
Feedback and Complaint Mechanisms; and e) activation of 
school DRR clubs. The Nutrition sector has made available 
stocks to respond to potential needs and estimates that 
approximately 5,000 children can be reached in case of severe 
acute malnutrition (SAM) and 15,000 for moderate acute 
malnutrition (MAM). The Health sector has worked with the 
Ministry of Health (MoH) to carry out health risk profiling and 
100 Cholera kits were procured and provided to the MoH to 
respond to potential cholera outbreaks.

RESPONSE STRATEGY AND 

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

This plan focuses on life-saving interventions in the most 
affected provinces. It covers the period from November 2018 
to June 2019 to enable the implementation of immediate 
response interventions as well as initial early recovery 
activities and restoration of livelihoods for the affected 
population from March to June 2019. The sectors have 
identified the most appropriate activities to reinforce the 
coping mechanisms of communities through approaches that 
are more sustainable and cost-efficient, including through 
cash-based programming. The Food and Agricultural sectors 
have been prioritised as key component of the strategy 
with WASH, Nutrition, Education, Protection and Health 
complementing the response. 

The likelihood of El Niño occurrence might prompt the revision 
of the response plan towards April 2019. However, the current 
response strategy outlined in this document will already 
contribute to mitigating the potential impacts of drought 
conditions in the south and central regions by initiating early 
recovery activities.

Strategic Objective 1 

 Provide immediate life-saving and life-sustaining assistance to the population 
affected by severe food insecurity

 

 This Strategic Objective reflects the commitment of all partners to prioritise immediate life-saving assistance for the 815,000 
most vulnerable people. The aim is to provide an integrated, cross-sectoral response to comprehensively stabilise the food 
security crisis. Under this Strategic Objective, partners will reach the most vulnerable with urgently needed humanitarian assistance. 
This will be done by improving immediate access to food, through in kind, and/or cash and food vouchers, vital nutrition 
and health and WASH support to reduce morbidity and mortality among vulnerable children, girls, pregnant and lactating 
women, boys and men, and vital protection services. School feeding will be provided to children in the worst affected districts.

Strategic Objective 2

 Support the restoration of the livelihoods of drought-affected people 
through resilience-building interventions to mitigate the humanitarian 
impacts of erratic weather 

 

 A key component of this Strategic Objective is to ensure that emergency relief programs enhance sustainability. Partners in 
this plan commit to develop emergency programs in a way that empowers affected people to become more self-reliant and 
combat cyclical drought-related aid dependency. Humanitarian partners will also engage relevant Government and development 
partners to prioritise longer-term resilience activities within existing programs (e.g. UNDAF). Response will prioritise the 
provision of basic services and livelihood opportunities to vulnerable people, including reliable access to food and nutrition, 
education, and water, hygiene and sanitation to ensure that basic needs are met.

EDUCATION

$3.6 

MILLION

Total required

Drought has a negative impact on children’s well-being and their access to education since 
drought often leads to student absenteeism, poor concentration in class and ultimately 
contributes to a decrease in their learning outcomes. The shortage of water and food 
availability leads to migration of the most vulnerable rural families and consequently their 
children drop out of school. 

The Education Sector intervention will focus on emergency school feeding, strengthening the 
education system to provide education for children affected by the current food insecurity 
and supporting local authorities to establish mitigation mechanisms through assessment and 
prevention activities, reducing the impact of the drought on the most vulnerable population. 

Under SO1, WFP will assist 60,000 school children in 133 primary schools in Gaza and 
Tete provinces with school meals, engaging local suppliers and associations. This activity, 
implemented under the umbrella of the Government’s National School Feeding Programme 
(PRONAE), aims to reduce absenteeism and promote gender inclusiveness of girls and boys in 
primary schools in drought-affected districts. This builds on previous support to the national 
school feeding programmes in those provinces, established coordination arrangements with 
counterparts and requests. 

The total amount requested for the intervention is estimated at $3.6 million

MILLION

Total required

The Agriculture and Livelihoods component of the Food Security Sector plan is based on the 
Government Contingency Plan scenarios for the 2018-2019 season, which indicates that in the 
agricultural sector about 583,000 people (116,700 households) will be directly affected by the 
drought during the lean season. 

The Agriculture and Livelihoods activities willl directly target approximately 150,000 people 
(about 30,000 households) focusing on the protection of livelihoods, including ensuring 
availability of livestock forage, livestock vaccination and the distribution of seeds of off-season 
crops.

The Agriculture and Livelihoods plan includes engagement of the relevant government 
counterpart to strengthen an in-depth Food and Nutrition Security (FNS) analysis and seed 
assessments to timely identify key early actions to be implemented during the current 
agricultural campaign. The result will also support the adequate planning for the next main 
agricultural campaign.

The beneficiaries targeted will fall under the livestock vaccination. However, the assessments 
that will be made in the course of the implementation will allow for further analysis to tailor the 
interventions accordingly. 

The total amount requested for the intervention is estimated at $4.9 million to be spent starting 
early March.

FOOD SECURITY:

FOOD ASSISTANCE

$39.7 

MILLION

Total required

Under the overall coordination of the National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC), the 
Food Security Sector (FSS) plans to address the food needs for 815,000 severely food-insecure 
people in five priority provinces, through conditional and unconditional transfers such as in-
kind, vouchers, and cash using the most suitable delivery mechanisms to best respond to the 
specific needs of the affected populations. 

Under Strategic Objective 1 (SO1), life-saving food assistance will target about 700,000 food-
insecure people (85 per cent of total food insecure population) and will aim at maintaining 
acceptable level of food consumption, as well as prevent use of irreversible negative coping 
mechanisms, while preventing further deterioration of nutritional status. 

In districts where SETSAN recommends immediate intervention, food assistance will be 
provided from November 2018 to April 2019 either through national Shock Responsive Social 
Protection (SRSP) schemes, or via Humanitarian Assistance (HA) implemented as per the Food 
Security Cluster (FSC) Standards Operating Procedures (2017). District authorities supported 
by FSS members will be responsible for identifying the most affected communities. To be 
entitled for assistance, households must either be existing National Institute of Social Action – 
Basic Social Subsidy Program (INAS PSSB) beneficiaries, or eligible for INAS PSSB programme 
or fulfil characteristics within the vulnerability criteria. 

Under SO2, Food Security partners will continue to assist the 700,000 food-insecure people 
from May 2019 to June 2019 and beyond, with emphasis given to recovery activities. The first 
objective is to ensure the food and nutrition security of households through the provision of 
monthly food transfers, using cash, vouchers, or in-kind food transfers. The second objective 
is to enhance land productivity, supporting the livelihoods of the targeted households and 
contributing to disaster risk reduction. Recovery activities will serve as an income transfer 
mechanism that helps prevent the forced sale of assets and promotes the investment of 
limited household income in durable economic and social activities, thus enabling families to 
recover from temporary food insecurity more rapidly. These will be selected based on the local 
context, priorities, and capacities, considering longer-term resilience-building potential in the 
areas. At the provincial level, this will be guided by the Local Adaptation Plans, which WFP and 
partners have supported to become sensitive to seasonal fluctuations and impacts of climate 
shocks. These are further localised and translated to the community level through participatory 
planning exercises that are used to specify the type of activities to be implemented in greater 
detail. Activities are then implemented with specific work norms and standards to maximise 
its effectiveness. Transfer value and ration will aim to provide a ration covering a minimum of 
75 per cent and 50 per cent of the average required per person per day (2,100 kilocalories) to 
those respectively in IPC 3 and 2 areas.

Partners will support SETSAN in conducting a Food Security and Nutrition Assessment 
in March/April 2019 to assess the impact of the 2018-2019 agricultural campaign on the

NUTRITION

$3

MILLION

Total required

Based upon the IPC Acute Malnutrition analysis and aggravating factors in the conflict-affected 
northern districts of Cabo Delgado, the Nutrition Sector defined the most appropriate response 
strategy by targeting nine districts (Balama, Marara, Milange, Macossa, Namuno, Macomia, 
Quissanga, Mocimboa da Praia and Nangade). 

Within the nine targeted districts, it is estimated that 19,500 children will suffer from acute 
malnutrition during the next six months. In line with the SO1, the Nutrition sector is targeting 
9,750 children (50 per cent) for treatment during this period; including 3,305 children with 
severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and 6,445 children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM).

The priority interventions are 1) active case finding of acutely malnourished cases at 
community level; 2) case management of acutely malnourished children under-five and 
pregnant and lactating women at community level; 3) and support for Infant and Young Child 
Feeding in the context of emergency. 

As part of the response, nutrition partners are involved in monitoring, coordination, information 
management, and communications activities. All those activities are being done in support 
and in coordination with the Ministry of Health, which is the sole provider of treatment of acute 
malnutrition services in the country. The Nutrition Sector has seven members actively involved 
in the nutrition response activities for the nine districts identified. 

Overall financial needs to respond to the nutrition emergency in the nine districts identified 
was estimated at $3 million for a six-month period and includes purchase of essential supplies 
and equipment, training and deployment of volunteers and outreach teams for identification 
of cases and case management and supportive activities (i.e. monitoring, coordination, 
information management, communication).

PROTECTION

$1.2 

MILLION

Total required

In the context of the evolving humanitarian landscape in Mozambique - characterised by severe 
food deprivation especially Gaza, Inhambane, Sofala, Tete and Cabo Delgado provinces - 
attention should be focused on protection and gender concerns. 

In line with the strategic objectives of the plan, the Protection Sector priority activities aim at: 
1) advocating and mainstreaming of protection in humanitarian response; 2) responding to 
urgent protection concerns with specific interventions in the context of the drought response; 
3) providing advisory support and advocacy for gender-responsive intervention. 

The Protection Sector intervention strategy is to reduce and mitigate vulnerable groups’ 
exposure to potential protection risks. These risks include, as noted in previous drought 
situations, that women have had to spend in excess of six hours searching for and transporting 
water to their homes. As a result, younger girls and adolescents were pulled from school to 
assist their parents or other family members with searching for and transporting water. In 
addition, during the water collection activities, girls are facing increased risk of confrontations 
and gender-based violence. Access to sanitary supplies for menstrual hygiene became a 
challenge. Time requirements for water collection reduced the amount of water women were 
transporting home and limited the amount of water available for personal hygiene. This forced 
many women to bath in close proximity to the water points and away from private spaces. Past 
anecdotal evidence suggests that the age of sexual debut lowered to 11 or 12 years during 
drought period with older men engaging with girls aged 11 to 13 as they went about water 
collection activities.

Protection actors should ensure that the most vulnerable, including children, women, elderly, 
people with disability and people with chronic diseases, are protected from: a) sexual violence 
and abuse; b) forced prostitution; c) physical violence; d) loss of life; e) socio-economic 
deprivation; f) Emotional GBV; g) harmful traditional practices GBV including, forced child 
marriage; and h) denial of education and other basic services.

The protection sector plan to target 10 per cent of the drought-affected population with an 
overall requirement of $1.2 million.

RESILIENCE AND EARLY RECOVERY

$0.75 

MILLION

Total required

The Early Recovery Sector will focus on supporting communities and government institutions 
to recover from the impacts of recurrent droughts. The sector’s activities will be implemented 
under SO2, aiming to support the restoration of the livelihoods of drought-affected population 
through resilience-building interventions. The sector will increase its coordination and capacity 
for humanitarian activities to achieve better inter-sectoral coordination and to create the 
important links to development and resilience programming. 

This will include the following actions:

• In collaboration with the government, ensure strengthening of their capacities for effective 
responses, recovery planning, coordination and information management - relevant data 
is collected and analysed to support humanitarian interventions and the development of a 
recovery strategy for building back better;

• Support the government in the prioritisation of activities or interventions for resilience 
building in the food for assets program;

• Support the Government to establish a monitoring mechanism for the response interventions;

• Support relevant line ministries as well as humanitarian and development partners 
understanding of the needs, response priorities and ongoing programming;

• Strengthen the existing coordination forums for the discussion and integration of cross-
cutting issues such as DRR, environment, gender, governance and strengthen accountability to 
affected populations by all sectors and partners.

The sector estimates that $750,000 is needed to implement the plan and assist around 70,000 
people.

WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE

$2.1

MILLION

As the food security assessment did not provide in depth analysis of water needs in food 
insecure districts, the need of water was estimated based on the actual coverage of safe 
water access in rural areas (35 per cent). Therefore, it is estimated that approximately 530,000 
people in food insecurity districts are in need of water. The Water, Sanitation and Hygiene 
(WASH) Sector plans to provide immediate response to the specific needs of some 296,250 
people impacted by the drought and Cholera related health outbreak. Responses include 
upgrading water points to become drought resilient, setup of solar powered multi-use water 
(MUS) systems, rehabilitation of water points, and water trucking (only in extreme cases). 

WASH is a critical initial response in any emergency where people are displaced from their 
homes and are surviving in precarious circumstances without normal arrangements for food, 
shelter and WASH. From the outset, it is critical to provide safe drinking water and adequate 
sanitation facilities, which meet beneficiary minimum requirements for cooking, drinking, and 
bathing, and which ensure hygienic excreta disposal with safety, privacy and dignity. 

Given the country vulnerability to extreme natural events, the WASH response strategies 
include both a focus on immediate response as well as maintaining a long-term vision on 
providing more resilient water supply infrastructures. The WASH Sector will, therefore, work to 
ensure that affected population access and use safe drinking water and sanitation facilities 
and adopt safe hygiene practices. This will include:

• Water supply: (i) water trucking only where absolutely necessary; (ii) cleaning & disinfection 
of existing water points; (iii) rehabilitation/upgrading (solar MUS) of existing or construction of 
new water points; (iv) distribution of point-of-use water treatment & purification products and 
household water storage supplies; (v) water quality monitoring;

• Sanitation: (i) constructions of communal latrines and bathing facilities/areas for affected 
people in accommodation centres; (ii) provision of communal solid waste containers 
(iii) promotion activities for self-construction of household latrines and garbage pits in 
resettlement and returning areas (including the provision of sanitation supplies for most 
vulnerable households);

• Hygiene Promotion: (i) intensified hygiene promotion activities to strengthen people 
awareness and adoption of safe hygiene practices; (ii) distribution of hygiene kits.

Around $2.1 million is required by the sector to assist 296,000 people.

PREPAREDNESS PLAN

The Mozambique Government, through the National Institute for Disaster 
Management (INGC), ministries, UN agencies and various non-governmental 
organisations (NGOs), developed a National Contingency Plan that is updated 
annually to reflect the evolving hazard profile of the country

Mozambique has experienced an increase in hazardous events including disease outbreaks, 
floods, droughts and storms. These natural hazards often trigger food, nutrition and health 
insecurity, and gender inequalities. Infrastructure including roads, public buildings and dwelling 
houses are also damaged. On the micro level, this has resulted in more fragile and less resilient 
family units while on the macro level there is the opportunity cost of diverting resources to 
respond to these emergencies. Evidence continues to show that disasters are likely to increase 
in Mozambique. In the last five years, the country recorded five extreme events (an average of 
one event per year) that affected at least 2 million people and damaged a number of social and 
economic infrastructure. Such events recorded two major floods in 2013 and 2015, a major 
El Niño-induced drought in 2015/2016 – one of the strongest in the last 30 years -, a cyclone 
category III in 2017 and lately a tropical depression in 2018. It seems that the frequency and 
intensity of climate-related shocks have intensified over the past years. 

The humanitarian community and the Government of Mozambique have drawn a contingency 
plan for critical areas likely to experience drought, floods and cyclone during the 2018-2019 
rainy season. This plan involves cross-sectoral actors at local and national level. 

The most likely scenario for the current season (2018/2019), based on the technical analysis 
as well as historical data, indicate that around 1.5 million will be exposed to drought, floods and 
cyclone. 

The national authorities for Water Resource management foresee for the period of January-
March 2019 high risk (75-100 per cent) of floods is expected in the northern region of the 
country (Megaruma and Messalo river basins) as well as moderate to high risk (50-75 per 
cent) in the central region (mainly two river basins). In particular, the hydrological forecast for 
the first quarter of 2019 identifies: (i) moderate flood risk in the Mutamba, Inhanombe, Buzi, 
Pungue, Zambezi, Lurio, Meluli, Mecuburi, Ligonha, Monapo and Lugenda hydrographic basins; 
(ii) moderate to high flood risk in the Savane, Licungo and Montepuez river basins; and (iv) high 
flood risk in the Megaruma and Messalo river Basins.

To mitigate the risks mentioned above, the Government approved a Contingency Plan and 
allocated about US$ 3.4 million out of US$ 18.3 million needed. Part of this funding is already being used to assist the affected population with 
food and water. The humanitarian community is appealing USD 14.6 million to the preparedness effort in support to the government.

Strategic objective 1 

 Implement readiness action for rapid onset hazards (floods and cyclones) to 
minimise potential humanitarian consequences in affected districts

 

 This plan is part of an important disaster preparedness process which allows Government and its partners to plan for 
disasters with the aim of minimising damage to property and loss of life. 

 Assessment teams composed by Government and humanitarian partners at national, provincial and district level will 
conduct joint assessment at the onset of the disaster to identify and quantify the extent of damages to people, livelihoods 
and infrastructure in the affected areas. This information will allow activation of a coordinated and effective response to the 
situation if required.

The aim of the agriculture sector is to ensure that long-term food insecurity due to loss of productive 
assets is prevented in flood-affected areas. The agriculture interventions will focus on providing timely 
seed and agricultural tools for the households affected by floods in the main river basins. The priority 
preparedness interventions are: 1) distribution of seeds of off-season crops (vegetable); 2) Distribution of 
agricultural tools. The sector will conduct a capacity mapping assessment of the service providers as well 
as the availability of seeds and agricultural tools in the country. As a result of this exercise, an agreement 
can be established to enable prompt action when needed.

According to the National Contingency Plan for the season 2018/2019, which is in line with the 
Regional seasonal forecast, strong winds, floods and cyclones are expected to impact the education 
sector, affecting 2,411 schools located in disaster-prone areas. Consequently, 613,998 students and 
11,873 teachers will likely need assistance in terms of education supplies and equipment. The main 
preparedness activities are: 1) pre-positioning of emergency items (school tents, school-in-a-box, learner 
kits, mobile chalkboards); 2) undertake mapping exercise to determine location of districts/schools that 
are in risk of being affected by flood; 2) identification, stocking and pre-positioning of tents in UNICEF 
warehouse and in potential affected areas as appropriate; 4) ensure involvement of collaborating partners 
in preparedness activities, including information sharing, establish coordination structures, etc.

The food security cluster partners need to secure contingency stocks to enable timely food assistance 
to 150,000 cyclone/flood-affected population. Food assistance will be provided through unconditional 
transfers in various modalities (in-kind, vouchers, and cash), depending on context. 100 per cent ration 
will be provided for a month to people who experienced a total loss of assets and food stocks. It is 
estimated that a total of US$ 2.5 million is needed to assist the population that might be affected by rapid 
onset disasters.

The health cluster anticipates that water-related disease outbreak is likely to be the most prominent 
hazard that could result in a health-related disasters. Floods and cyclone historically are associated 
with high risk of disease outbreaks, especially cholera, which occurred in the last years and resulted in 
significant levels of morbidities and mortalities. The Health Cluster has worked with Ministry of Health 
(MoH) and has done health risk profiling - based on the identified potential health risk which include 
flooding, cyclone and diseases such as cholera, plague and Ebola. Cholera kits were procured and 
provided to the MoH to respond for potential outbreak. The health cluster has assisted the Ministry 
of Health in developing a cholera contingency plan aiming at early detecting and timely responding to 
the outbreak. The high maternal mortality ratio, 408 per 100,000 live births (DHS, 2011), and access to 
health services by women are other important challenges. In an event of floods or cyclone, approximately 
160,000 women in reproductive age (WRA) will likely be affected, of which 15,000 are pregnant. In 
addition, Mozambique is an HIV epidemic country with 11.5 per cent prevalence and emergencies have 
shown increasing vulnerability amongst certain population groups, including women and children. Health 
units with HIV/AIDS services may be abruptly disrupted during emergencies, leaving people with HIV or on 
HIV/AIDS treatment at risk of major health setbacks.

Therefore, priority preparedness actions include: 1) enhance early disease detection and reporting by 
providing trainings for health workers at district and health facility levels on cholera surveillance, case 
management and infection prevention; 2) trainings to community members on the prevention and control 
of cholera and on community case definition; 3) support the establishment of provincial and district level 
Rapid Response Team (RRTs); 4) ensure Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) for Reproductive Health 
to be implemented on the onset of the emergency; 5) ensure comprehensive HIV/AIDS preparedness, 
including prevention, treatment, care, support and pre-position of essential medicines and supplies in 
high-risk areas.

The aim of the NFIs and Emergency shelter sector is to provide decent and adequate shelter to flood-affected 
victims whose houses have been washed away. This will be done through the provision of adequate 
shelter to flood affected victims and the provision of survival kits and other basic Non-Food Items 
(NFIs) to the flood affected people. The NFIs and Emergency shelter priority preparedness activity is the 
identification, stocking and pre-positioning of tents and other NFIs for potential flood-affected districts in 
the country for community/household level use.

The nutrition sector expects an increase in malnutrition among children under five, lactating and 
pregnant women in flood-affected areas. Therefore, the aim is to prevent acute moderate malnourished 
children under five, lactating and pregnant women from eventually deteriorating to a situation of severe 



malnutrition, while ensuring that severely malnourished children under five have continued access to 
therapeutic feeding support. The nutrition sector has made available stocks to respond to potential needs. 
According to the stocks available, approximately 5,000 children can be reached in case of severe acute 
malnutrition (SAM) and 15,000 for moderate acute malnutrition (MAM). The preparedness activities 
will consist in active case finding, strengthening the capacity and coverage of health/nutrition services, 
increasing the capacity for monitoring and evaluate the nutrition situation, increase adequate Infant and 
Young Child Feeding promotion. In terms of readiness, the nutrition supplies are already in place, as 
the contingency stock for humanitarian situations are ready to cover the expected caseload of children 
with acute malnutrition. Nevertheless, the reserve to attend vulnerable populations with malnutrition, on 
possible further deteriorating scenarios linked to El Niño phenomenon, will need further reinforcement.

Additional funding will be required to set up a monitoring system through Mid-Upper Arm Circumference 
measure (MUAC) screenings in different districts of Mozambique, and to replenish the contingency stocks 
that will be used in the actual response in preparation of potential humanitarian situations linked to 
drought, flood and cyclone hazard.

The protection cluster preparedness effort is to assist the most vulnerable people to ensure that children 
and women are protected from exploitation, violence, abuse and neglect resulting from an emergency. 
Therefore, the aim is to ensure that vulnerable communities will have a dignified and secure access to 
adequate water, sanitation, food, nutrition, shelter and healthcare. The priority preparedness actions are: 
1) provision of advisory support and advocacy for gender-responsive action plan; 2) ensure a system is 
in place at district level for identification, registration and reunification of children displaced during the 
flood or cyclone events; 3) support establishment of sentinel sites in all flood prone districts to provide 
information on impact on children and women during the emergency. The preparedness plan aim at 
assisting 60,000 people in need of urgent protection intervention and it requires USD 360,000.

The 2018/2019 Government Contingency Plan estimates a total of 357,195 people are at risk of floods 
during the upcoming rainy season across the country. Out of this, 107,159 people (nearly 30 per cent 
of people at risk), are estimated to potentially need humanitarian assistance, including the provision of 
safe drinking water, sanitation facilities and support to enable them to perform safe hygiene practices. 
Given the resources available and partner capacity to mobilise additional resources, the WASH Cluster 
partners will provide WASH humanitarian assistance to 50 per cent of the people in need of assistance 
(53,579 people) with the remaining 50 per cent expected to be supported by the Government. The priority 
preparedness activities are: 1) update and maintain a mapping of WASH partners (4W) and conduct 
assessments of areas identified with high water resource vulnerability (flood and cholera prone areas); 
2) identify and upgrade existing capacity of water and sanitation structures in areas that are likely to 
temporarily host displaced people; 3) ensure that all necessary supplies, including water treatment 
products (Certeza) are procured and pre-positioned/distributed; 4) provide people with access to water, 
sanitation, hygiene promotion information, including point-of-use water treatment safe practices.
